One of those insights on changing trends has been the enormous growth of cold coffee beverages, which led to the recent introduction of <a href=https://foodie.sysco.com/tips-and-trends/cold-brew/><strong>Citavo Imperial Cold Brew Concentrate</strong></a>."

To ensure that  all Sysco specifications are met, the company conducts a series of rigorous checks. That means sampling the product multiple times throughout the process. “When we’re purchasing coffee for the Citavo line,” says Griffith, “we sample the coffee when it leaves the country of origin and when it gets to port. We get a sample at our dock, and then we take another sample after it has been roasted. It is all about ensuring that it meets S&D and Sysco’s stringent quality requirements.”"
