                "During the holidays, shoppers may be frantically scrambling to pick up those final items on their gift lists, but they’re still making time to dine out. Since customers are willing to pay more for an exceptional dining experience not to mention the fact that so many flavors associated with the holidays are sweet (think eggnog, peppermint, and pumpkin everything)  the holidays are an excellent time to drive dessert sales.",
                "Here are some tips from Vince Veneziano, Senior Vice President of Corporate Accounts at Lyons Magnus, and the Cheesecake Factory’s Tony Gressak, Vice President of Distributor Sales, and Alan Lee, executive pastry chef and Senior Manager of Bakery Research and Development, for turning desserts into sweet profits this holiday season."

                "Take a classic slice of cheesecake. It’s a simple delight. On the plate all by itself, however, it can look a little underwhelming. Simply adding a drizzle of strawberry, rich chocolate or salted caramel sauce can transform both the flavor and the visual appeal of the dessert. Whether pooled underneath, drizzled in a pattern on top, or served in a ramekin on the side, a sauce has the power to change the entire character of a dessert."
