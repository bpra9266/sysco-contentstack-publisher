According to a recent report by the International Journal of Applied Management <strong>and</strong> Technology, approximately 31% to 40% of the food served to customers never gets consumed.",
                    "Spurred by ever-changing market trends <strong>and</strong> consumer eating habits, restaurants often use larger portion sizes so customers perceive a value for the <strong>food</strong> purchase.",
                    "In the United States especially, restaurants consistently offer portion sizes that are two to three times what the average customer should be consuming in a meal. This trend is not only a primary reason more <strong>food</strong> is <strong>waste</strong>d, but also contributes to the increasing obesity rates in the US.",
                    "However, in a report conducted by international climate action NGO, <strong>WRAP, customer behaviors and</strong> attitudes towards <strong>food waste</strong> when dining out are changing. More than three in five people are concerned about wasting food when they eat out. In 2012, 41% of people said ‘the portion was too big’ resulting in leftovers, but today that number has risen to 48%.",
                    "One measure to address this problem is to offer smaller portion sizes at a lower price while still offering larger portion sizes at a higher price. This would permit customers with smaller appetites to order a smaller meal <strong>and</strong> presumably leave less behind, while also lowering preparation <strong>and food waste</strong> costs for the restaurant.",

In this way, portions will look bigger.",
                    "Training is also key. Even with veteran players in the kitchen, it’s vital to train <strong>and</strong> re-train employees on <strong>food waste and</strong> how to reduce it. Educate cooks and servers on accurate portions of each dish, as well as emphasizing the use of tools such as measuring cups and scales. Conduct periodic portion audits to make sure that staff is staying within specified food weights.",
                    "Following a zero<strong>-waste</strong> philosophy, which includes watching portion sizes <strong>and</strong> plate waste, can reduce your <strong>food</strong> costs and increase your restaurant’s bottom line. Operators can also see cost savings on labor through more efficient handling, preparation, and storage of food that will be used. <strong>And</strong>, from an environmental standpoint, there are gains from the <strong>better</strong> management of energy and resources, preventing pollution involved in the growing, manufacturing, transporting, and selling of food.",
                    "We hope we’ve inspired you to start adopting some of these practices. As Anne Marie Bonneau, well-known zero <strong>waste</strong> chef, says, “We don’t need a handful of people doing zero waste perfectly. We need millions of people doing it imperfectly.”"

As with any raw food item, proper handling is critical. If you are not used to handling live or raw shellfish, try oysters from one of Sysco’s Specialty <strong>Seafood</strong> companies to get started. Their products are offered in various forms, from shucked oysters by the gallon to IQF oysters on the half shell. If you still want to preserve the shuck-and-serve experience, try Sysco High-Pressure Pasteurized (HPP) Oysters. This unique product uses high pressure to kill harmful bacteria while keeping the oyster in its shell."

                    "<strong>Spices</strong> are among the easiest and most approachable ways to experiment with new <a href=https://www.theculinarypro.com/global-flavors>global cuisines</a> and trends. The popularity of spice blends is continuing to grow in kitchens as they offer labor and cost savings.",
                    "In today’s challenging workforce environment, using <strong>pre-mixed spices</strong> alleviates the need for trained labor to entrust with the proper blending of spices. Plus, it also saves on having to buy multiple spices to create your own blends. As we gear up for the holiday season, the <strong>Sysco Foodie Team</strong> reached out to <strong>Chef Tony Reed</strong>, Executive Director of Culinary at <strong>Spiceology</strong>, to get some great tips and ideas on how to incorporate spices across your entire menu, including entrees, cocktails, and even kids’ menus!",
                    "More restaurants of all sizes are extending their <strong>spice blend</strong> and ingredients usage from the kitchen to bar and beverage stations. Spices like turmeric and <strong>ras el hanout</strong> are popping up more and more on drink menus. With its strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, turmeric has long been considered to have health benefits. And while you probably use it in your curries, rice dishes, and marinades, it’s also a great ingredient to add to cocktails.",
                    "Not only does it give them an extra flavor kick, with its reputation as a “superfood”, it adds just a little bit of a health halo too. Plus, its amazing color creates eye-catching visual appeal – a quality near and dear to today’s social media obsessed consumer, always looking for that next instagrammable sensation! The warm and slightly sweet flavor of ras en hanout is already super trendy in margaritas, but add it to winter favorites like spiked ciders and hot chocolates to lend a warm, comforting spice.",
                    "For a boozy cocktail that’s perfect as part of a fall menu, team it up with scotch, whiskey, or bourbon for a deliciously layered taste. Spice blends that include turmeric and other warm spices like cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, clove, and fennel can work easily to spike a whiskey sour but also add a depth of flavor to traditional cocoas for a spicy-sweet holiday treat.",
                    "Need a few “mocktails” for your bar menu, but want to shy away from the expected and try something more adventurous? These spices can lend great color, scent, and taste to non-alcoholic drinks, creating unusual and intriguing flavors.",
                    "“Zero-proof and no ABV mocktails are growing in popularity, and spices and herbs can actually mimic the bold flavors of cocktail ingredients,” explains Chef Tony Reed, Executive Director of Culinary at Spiceology. “So have fun and experiment with different spices and mixology – it’s a great way to innovate, talk about new menu additions, and differentiate yourselves from competitors.”",
                    "Warm up with these cozy favorites:",
                    "<strong>2) Expand Umami on the Menu</strong>",
                    "As interest in food and chef culture grows among guests, they are getting more savvy and craving authentic dining experiences. A perfect example of this rising hunger is for all things umami. And while umami is a well-known profile among Asian cuisine, it can shine and be celebrated in all types of dishes, lending savory flavors to vegetable entrees, sides and more.",
                    "Guests might not fully understand the science behind umami, but they do know it tends to taste amazing, and that global cuisines offer new ways to experience the umami sensation. Vegetable-centric entrees are becoming increasingly more popular, and adding umami ingredients to various dishes to create new, bolder <strong>flavor profiles</strong> makes these healthier foods more appealing and just as satisfying.",
                    "According to Chef Tony, “cheese, seafood, mushrooms, meats, kimchi, truffles – umami flavor can run the gamut, and we have the ingredients to prove it. Infusing these complex umami flavors via tadka, compound butters, etc. is now even easier with spice blends.”",
                    "Some ideas to try:",
                    "<strong>3) Go Big and Go Bold with Chiles</strong>",
                    "Diners are getting more adventurous when it comes to chiles and bolder heat profiles. Anyone who watches <strong>Hot Ones</strong>, the talk show where host Sean Evans interviews celebrities over a platter of increasingly spicy chicken wings, can attest to the power of a great hot sauce. But take it a step further, and add an interesting flavor, maybe a little sweet with the heat and it’s game on.",
                    "This combination of sweet and spicy – “swicy” – as the cool kids call it, is everywhere right now. According to Datassential, sweet and spicy pairings on menus are up 38% in the last year, and hot honey is projected to outpace nearly all other culinary and beverage flavors by 2027. Other notable flavors, like chili crunch and gochujang, are also being incorporated into dishes all over the place.",
                    "Salty, spicy, and smoky flavors are also worth noting. Urfa biber can add heat and deep chile flavor to any dish, while Calabrian chile pastes can add a spicy, smoky layer to aiolis, pastas, hummus, roasted meats, and veggies.",
                    "Chamoy is delicious in margaritas, but try making a paste to use as a rim for cocktails, micheladas, or beer. Need slightly less heat and more of a slow build? Try Aleppo pepper for marinades and salad dressings. It’s also great at the bar to rim a cocktail glass.",
                    "As Chef Tony says, “there are regions around the world known for their chiles – know that origin when building a globally inspired dish. Chiles add a complex-yet-approachable heat profile, but add in a spice blend with chiles and other ultra-versatile flavor combinations and you’re easily taking a dish to a bolder next level and achieving easy consistency.”",

                    "<strong>4) Kiddos Want to Go Global</strong>",
                    "It’s time for operators, including restaurants and cafeteria foodservice, to think beyond mac and cheese, pizza, and chicken nuggets. While these are indeed kids’ menu staples, Gen Alpha is growing up in a more diverse setting compared to previous generations. Due in no small part to streaming and social media, younger generations have had more exposure to different cultures and thus a better understanding around global cuisines.",
                    "According to a report from Datassential, bold and <strong>global flavors</strong>, from pulled pork to teriyaki chicken, lead the way in four-year growth for kids’ menus. As such, consider how globally-inspired concepts like rice bowls, pho, quesadillas, birria, and more could fit into your kids’ menus. Or start small and take a familiar item like chicken strips but add a fun twist using different spice blends.",
                    "Sauces are another key opportunity for flavor innovation on kids’ menus, as kids in general love to dip foods. Think beyond just the typical ketchup and get creative with condiments. Lean into globally-inspired condiment options like sriracha or sauces geared towards chicken pairings (chicken appears on 77% of kids’ menus, according to Menu Trends), such as honey BBQ.",
                    "As Chef Tony explains, “spice blends are an easy way to answer the demand for trending global flavors among younger generations – ramen, mac and cheese, pizza – these are all cornerstone  meals that can take on new global flavors the kids are wanting.”",
                    "Here are some recipes for quick menu inspiration:",

                    "Observed by Christians throughout the world, including Central and Eastern Europe, North America, and in the Levant, particularly in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Palestine, Saint Barbara’s Day is celebrated December 4th and represents the kickoff to the holiday season. According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, Barbara, a third-century martyr, was the beautiful daughter of a pagan, Dioscorus, who kept her guarded in a tower to protect her from harm. When she professed Christianity and refused marriage, he became enraged and took her to the provincial prefect, who ordered her to be tortured and beheaded. Hmmm….not such a nice guy.",
                    "Even worse, Dioscorus himself performed the execution and, upon his return home, was struck by lightning and reduced to ashes. Talk about karma.",
                    "Known as one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers, Saint Barbara is the patron saint of occupations related to lightning and fire, and protects artillerymen, firefighters, and miners. And while St. Barbara’s Day is celebrated across the globe, this holiday has special significance in Paterno, Sicily.",
                    "Sicilians honor the saint who saved the city from the Bubonic Plague. According to local lore, Santa Barbara appeared in a dream to a Benedictine nun in quarantine, and the nun begged her to save the city from the epidemic. The prayer was answered, the city defeated the plague, and Saint Barbara was proclaimed patron of the city in 1576.",
                    "In honor of Saint Barbara, we’ve crafted two delicious recipes as part of a traditional Sicilian feast for the holidays:  <strong>Eggplant Lasagna</strong> and <strong>Veal Cannelloni</strong>. Whether served as a main entrée, or prepared and packaged in bulk trays for to-go or off-premise entertaining, these hearty, filling dishes are sure to please.",

                    "<strong>Holiday Tamales</strong>",
                    "During the holiday season, <strong>tamales</strong> are a popular tradition across many Latin American countries as well as the United States. Tamales can be sweet or savory, and there are dozens of recipe variations, but these delicious packages all include a dough stuffed with a tasty filling, wrapped inside a type of corn husk or a leaf, and steamed.  Savory recipes might call for shredded beef, chicken, pork, and vegetables, while sweet ones may include bananas, chocolate, and raisins.",
                    "The sheer diversity of tamales is a tasty journey itself through various countries. In Mexico, tamales can vary from region to region, with some wrapped in banana leaves versus the traditional corn husks. Guatemalan versions have a distinctive flavor that uses cinnamon, cloves, and other spices. In Columbia, tamales are often made from yellow dough with rice, chickpeas and a hard boiled egg wrapped in a plantain leaf.",
                    "In Venezuela, “hallacas”, the country’s tasty take on tamales, usually feature a hearty meat stew with raisins, capers, and olives, wrapped in plantain leaves.",
                    "Popular in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, “pasteles en hoja” are similar to Mexican tamales, but they’re made from different ingredients. Instead of a corn “masa”, a plantain and root vegetables batter is used as the base. They can be stuffed with beef, chicken, or other filling and then wrapped in a green banana or plantain leaf, then boiled instead of steamed.",
                    "Fun fact – do know how tamales came to be associated with Christmas? We know them to be flavorful, richly filled pockets of deliciousness, but in ancient times, tamales were also considered a sacred dish.",
                    "Many indigenous tribes of Mesoamerica believed that the Gods provided corn specifically to keep humans thriving. Some cultures even tell stories of humankind being created from the corn itself. As such, corn-based dishes were a natural choice for ritual offerings.",
                    "When Spanish conquistadors invaded the Americas, they brought Christianity with them and the thinking is that over time tamales became associated with special occasions. As Christianity spread, the tradition was transferred to the most important holiday on the Christian calendar – Christmas.",
                    "Tamales have and continue to represent culture, tradition, memory, and life, a celebration of the season and of being together with family. Feature tamales as a menu offering, versatile as an appetizer, entrée or added to a combination plate. Better yet, package and sell them by the dozens to-go. Sysco International Masa Harina has a free flowing, fine texture, and a shorter prep time, requiring just a little water, minimal kneading, and a short heating time, making it ideal for high-volume operations.",

                    "Diwali is the Indian “festival of lights” – a holiday that celebrates the triumph of light over dark and good over evil, and the blessings of victory, freedom, and enlightenment. While the festival is linked to multiple different stories and texts, the most common and celebrated story that is associated with Diwali is that of Lord Rama along with his wife Sita and younger brother Lakshman returning to Ayodhya after a 14 year long exile and war where they defeated Lanka’s demon king Ravana. To welcome them, the people of Ayodhya adorned their homes and streets with clay lamps.",
                    "A five-day celebration, Diwali actually takes its name from the rows (avali) of clay lamps (deepa) that Indians light throughout their homes and in the streets to light up the dark night and symbolize the inner light that protects from spiritual darkness. Primarily observed by followers of the Hindu, Sikh, and Jain faiths, Diwali has since become a national festival that’s also enjoyed by non-Hindu communities around the globe.",
                    "Homes are decorated, and floors inside and out are covered with rangoli, consisting of elaborate designs made of colored rice, sand, or flower petals. The doors and windows of houses are kept open in the hope that Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity, will find her way inside and bless the residents with wealth and success.",
                    "The main celebration of Diwali takes place on the day of the new Moon, when the sky is at its darkest, so a big part of the celebration revolves around light. Candles, clay lamps, and oil lanterns are lit and placed throughout the home, in the streets, in areas of worship, and floated on lakes and rivers. Fireworks are also set off on the night of Diwali—said by some to ward off evil spirits.",
                    "During this time, like so many other <strong>cultural celebrations</strong>, food unites family and friends, links past and present, and is definitely the star of the show! Wearing their best new clothes, families gather to eat sweets and other special foods, light diyas (decorative oil lamps), and pray for their ancestors.",
                    "And while there are many different things that might be eaten during Diwali, the indulgent sweets always take center stage.",
                    "Two of our Sysco chefs’ favorite indulgences are Gulab jamuns and mango kulfi. Galub jamuns are little, fried balls of a milk-based dough that are soaked in a sugary syrup scented with cardamom, saffron, rose water, and other spices, served warm or at room temperature. Mango kulfi is frozen dessert made with mango, sweetened condensed milk, cream, sugar, cardamom and saffron. The batter is then poured into kulfi molds, steel cups, or popsicle molds and frozen until firm.",
                    "These treats are a great way to experiment with some new dessert options for your menu. Galub jamun can be made ahead of time and served warm or at room temperature. They hold well and extra product can be stored in the refrigerator for several days.",

                    "<strong>Up the Ante with Sunday Roast for the Holidays</strong>",
                    "While some guests will continually opt for the traditional ham or turkey dinner, patrons are always impressed with a quintessential English holiday dinner of roasted prime rib, Yorkshire pudding, and all the classic trimmings.",
                    "So fancy, the origin of the prime rib is believed to lie in Great Britain. Those from British households will recognize the standing rib roast as a traditional “Sunday Roast” – the meat would cook for long hours in the oven as the family attended church services. All resulting in an elementally British evening, built on generosity and conviviality, plus copious amounts of good food and drink.",
                    "Prime rib soon became a traditional Christmas meat, adorning the holiday tables of families in Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Canada, the United States, and many other parts of the world. Each country has its own traditions that tie in with what to serve with prime rib, but in Britain, Yorkshire pudding is the favored companion. These savory popovers are a deeply rooted part of the British food culture and have a long history as the perfect complement to the roast.",
                    "Prime rib is also a favored main course during the Jewish celebration of Hanukkah. Many observant Jews follow kosher dietary laws and will only prepare and eat kosher cuts of meat, cuts that are predominantly drawn from the forequarters of the animal. Muslim gourmands also adhere to a specific set of dietary laws, with permissible foods deemed halal. Depending on which set of guidelines are followed, prime rib can be certified kosher or halal, making it a great choice to appeal to a variety of patrons with different dietary lifestyles.  As one of the most flavorful and tender cuts of meat, prime rib has a certain decadence and elegance that adds a WOW factor to any holiday table. Hence it continues to extend its popularity as a special occasion meal across the globe.",
                    "Back in “the day”, the 1700s specifically, the pudding was traditionally cooked underneath a roast, where it would catch the drippings as the meat cooked. The drippings, essential in the diet, were utilized rather than lost to the fire. Sources of these essential fats, particularly in the North of England, were more difficult to obtain at that time, especially with the high cost of meat, so every single drop was used. Who knew that using those drippings would be an early example of “upcycling” food waste! Serving the rich, pillowy dish was also a way to fill guests up and stretch the costly main course.",
                    "Today, Yorkshire pudding is as popular as ever. For the perfect holiday dinner, you can’t go wrong with traditional Yorkshire pudding drenched in gravy, followed by roast beef and vegetables. Feature it as a seasonal limited time offering, and who knows? It may even make it on your menu as a new Sunday special!",
                    "Food is one of the most powerful ways we remind ourselves of our unique and distinct heritage, and the different cultures and culinary traditions of the holidays can add exciting new spins to old standards and offer new tastes as well. We hope we’ve inspired you to add a few new favorites to your menus as well!",

                    "Winter squash soup is super creamy and full of cozy fall flavor, a great way to take advantage of this wonderful and nutritious vegetable. While various versions of squash soup are known throughout Europe, North America, Africa, the Caribbean, Asia, and Australia, pumpkin soup, specifically soup joumou, holds special meaning during the holidays for the people of Haiti. Rich and savory, this soup features winter squashes like pumpkin, along with beef, vegetables, peppers, and spices.",
                    "During the colonial rule throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, enslaved Africans in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (now modern-day Haiti) cultivated the squash and prepared, cooked and served the soup, yet were prohibited from eating it themselves. The delicacy was a symbol of status, something reserved for French slave masters.  Following an insurrection that grew to a full-fledged revolution, Haitian slaves defeated the French military and declared for themselves a republic on January 1, 1804.",
                    "After freedom, it was time to celebrate by eating the decadent soup that was once forbidden to them. Every New Year’s, Haitians around the world consume soup joumou as a way to celebrate Haiti’s Independence Day.",
                    "Kabocha squash, also known as Japanese pumpkin, was first grown in Cambodia and was brought to Japan and South America by the Portuguese in the mid-16th century. With an especially sweet flavor, even sweeter than butternut squash, it’s delicious when pureed into a rich, thick soup, and equally as popular cubed in broth-style soups.",
                    "In Vietnam, kabocha squash is simmered with pork to make a traditional soup called canh bi do thit heo. Filled with tender ground pork marinated in fish sauce and sugar, this aromatic soup is full of fall flavor. Similar versions are also popular in Hawaii and the Phillipines. In Thailand, sweet coconut milk, ginger, cilantro, and lime transform this humble gourd into a luscious creamy soup.",
                    "Travel back across the South Atlantic Ocean and you’ll find squash soup is also prevalent in South African cuisine. Every variety of squash grows in South Africa, and the resulting soups are crafted with unique fusions of flavors, representing the incredibly diverse history, culture, and people of this region.",
                    "In the mid-17th century, the Dutch East India company established a trading post in <a href=http://www.go2africa.com/south-africa/map.asp>South Africa</a>, which was directly in the “Spice Route” and served and replenished sailors between Europe and Asia. As a result, the cuisine was heavily influenced by the Dutch, British, Indian, German, French, Portuguese, and Cape Malay immigrants. Many recipes of South African butternut squash soup still reflect this combination of cultures with ingredients such as roasted bananas, coconut milk, curry, nutmeg, allspice, and Peri-Peri seasoning.",
                    "Inspired by South Africa’s embrace of the various cultures and communities that influence their cuisine, we have a delicious recipe for Winter Squash soup that can be customized with a variety of different garnishes that add a bit of ethnic flair, including Hispanic, Italian, Indian, Asian, and Mediterranean themed toppings.",

Assuming leadership at family cookouts was instinctual for him, as was cooking for his friends, and it was here he recognized that both guiding and cooking were his creative outlets.",
                    "Chef <strong>Brian</strong> attended a small culinary school in his hometown, and upon graduating, came across a job posting for a restaurant named L’etoile in Charlottesville, Virginia. After a few years at L’etoile, Chef Brian followed a few cooks to the Clifton Inn, where the new chef there needed a pastry chef. Even though Chef Brian had never worked pastry, he discovered a newfound passion. He was good at the basics and really enjoyed doing it. After a year of crafting his own desserts, he decided it was time to spread his wings and learn more. A former cook he had worked with had moved to New York, so he called him up and asked if his restaurant was hiring in pastry. As fate would have it, they were indeed hiring and Chef Brian decided it was time to move to the Big Apple. He began his big city career working for Bouley, one of New York’s top fine-dining restaurants, before moving on to Eleven Madison Park, a 3-Michelin-star gem that has also been ranked among the world’s 50 best restaurants.",
                    "Chef <strong>Brian</strong> gained his vast expertise from NYC’s cultural melting pot. Most proud of his experience as a pastry sous chef at Eleven Madison Park, he’s learned to thrive in an environment that fosters culinary excellence and innovation.",
                    "Aside from enjoying movies at home with his wife and expanding his vast Lego® collection, Chef <strong>Brian</strong> is incredibly passionate about creating strategic solutions to help his customers thrive in the most competitive restaurant scene in the country. As he explains, “as a chef, my calling extends beyond the kitchen. I’m dedicated to coaching and empowering people to elevate their businesses.”",
                    "Admittedly frugal himself, Chef <strong>Brian</strong> translates that into his role of helping chefs operate more efficiently and sustainably. He champions resource consolidation and waste reduction, focusing on elevating plate value while minimizing food costs. “I love showing people the breadth of what we offer,” says Chef Brian. For him, Sysco’s offerings extend far beyond what meets the eye, and he takes great pride in demonstrating how to utilize Sysco products to create fine dining dishes and experiences.",
