The delicious smell, along with a powerful combination of starch, salt and fat create a flavor and mouth feel that can be difficult to resist. But like any great dynamic duo – think peanut butter and jelly, bacon and eggs, cinnamon and sugar – French fries also have a perfect partner that helps create their iconic status – salt.",

For example, <strong>PillsburyTM 9-inch preformed pie shells</strong>, made with lard or vegetable shortening, offer a tender shortbread-like texture in a metal tin with a specially designed slope and lip to increase dough stability and minimize breakage. The neutral flavor works well for both sweet and savory pies.

We have forty-five televisions, but when we were advertising, I wouldn’t allow anyone to call [us] a sports bar because [we’re] not. We’re food first! There are days we have games on and may have about fifty to sixty people at the bar, but in the dining room, we have families and people from all walks of life.”"

                        "Although desserts have often gotten mixed reviews when it comes to adding dollars to the bottom line, a strategically engineered dessert menu can increase check averages, driving incremental profits for operators. According to Datassentials*, 60% of operators say the desserts they serve help to drive profits. As you develop a strategy on how to market and price your desserts, it’s extremely important to keep your food cost percentage in mind. Here are some factors to take into consideration when pricing your dessert menu.",
                        "1. List and price out all the ingredients. Start by listing all the ingredients that go into your dessert. Include everything – from any scratch ingredients, mixes, or batters to the cooking spray used in the cake pan. Determine the quantity of each ingredient that goes into each serving so you can then calculate your cost per serving.",
                        "2. Factor in any overhead. Is there any special equipment required to make it? If an item needs to be refrigerated overnight, include the cost of the saran wrap used to preserve it. Add in your labor costs. If a dessert is being made from scratch, how much time does it take your kitchen staff to prep, bake, and plate the items?",
                        "3. Price it Out. Add your food cost and any equipment and labor cost for your total food cost. Add your desired profit margin to your total food cost to equal the price you should charge to a guest. Choosing a reasonable profit margin is delicate work. It’s important to choose a price that is fair – if the item is priced too high, guests will be unwilling to order it. If an item is priced too low, your establishment may not make enough of a profit. Make sure you know your target demographic and what they expect prices to be, as well as what nearby competitors charge.",

                        "Now that you know how to price your desserts, what are some ways to optimize profits? Rather than raise prices or decrease portion sizes, operators can maximize profit by using speed-scratch products. Items like Baker’s Source ready to bake pies and scoop and bake muffin batters are  timesaving solutions that require minimal prep, save valuable labor costs, and enhance back of house operations. Operators can serve with confidence as these products have a remarkable consistency and homemade taste that your customers will never know they were not scratch-made. “Deconstruct” a traditional dessert like carrot cake and give it a creative visual twist. Prepare Baker’s Source Sunrise Muffin Batter in square sheet pans, cut the cake into small cubes, then dress the plate with pieces of cake, dollops of spiced cream cheese, and candied walnuts. Build a towering trifle with layers of Sysco Imperial Old Fashioned ready to bake Apple Pie, Wholesome Farms Vanilla Ice Cream, and our Sysco Classic Caramel Sauce, topped with crumbled cookies or infused whipped cream. Looking to celebrate a hometown sports team? Baker’s Source White Cake Mix requires the user to only add water to create moist tender cakes with a smooth sweet vanilla taste. Add food coloring, different fruits, candies, or nuts, or top with colored frosting to reflect high school or college colors. A “plain” cheesecake such as Sysco Imperial Plain New York Cheesecake can be transformed into a swoon-worthy dessert with the addition of fresh, seasonal berries and unique sauces drizzled onto the plate. Simple customizations can enhance the appeal and command a more premium price point, adding more dollars to your bottom line!",

But when you think of barbecue, we often think of proteins like brisket, pork, and ribs. Chicken doesn’t always come to mind. However, according to Datassential, one of the leading food and beverage market research and intelligence platforms, chicken is the most popular protein on menus paired with the term barbecue. In addition, more boneless chicken preparations, including chicken breasts and tenders, are appearing in barbecue dishes at restaurants.",

Barbecue sauces are also expanding into areas with different fruits and spices, as well as “boozy” concoctions made with spirits such as bourbon and whiskey.

                        "As the Lenten season and Easter quickly approach, restaurants are gearing up and adding new seafood dishes to their menus in anticipation of increased guest demand for meatless options. Favorites like fish and shrimp top the list, and it’s easy to see why. Extremely versatile, these proteins offer chefs endless creative options to design signature dishes and boost check averages.",
                        "Whether baked, broiled or grilled, swordfish is a delicious addition to any menu. Its meaty texture, mild flavor and abundance of omega-3 fatty acids are all part of its popularity. Also packed with protein, nutrients, and healthy omega-3 fatty acids, salmon has a tender texture and a mild to rich flavor. Salmon pairs deliciously well with a wide variety of bold marinades, spices, seasonings, and sauces and can be prepared in recipes that cross the culinary landscape, from a classic teriyaki glaze to green curry or even a roasted salmon with spring pesto. Whether baked, broiled, grilled, poached, or pan-fried, this famous fish can find a place on any menu and represent a variety of cultures.",

                        "For most operators, packaging was just another line item cost to minimize. However, consumers have become more conscious of being eco-friendly and look for packaging that is made with better, ideally more sustainable materials. The race is on to balance the environmental concerns of consumers with the reality of running a profitable operation and managing not just food costs but costs of goods as well. While many operators are hesitant to pay more premium prices for sustainable packaging, recent surveys from the National Restaurant Association have found that consumers are willing to pay extra for to-go orders to cover the cost of upgraded packaging. In addition, everyone is aware of the impact of inflation on food prices, whether it’s a restaurant or a grocery store. Consumers expect to see prices climb a bit and are more understanding when restaurant owners make needed adjustments. With guests willing to foot the bill so far, now is the time to invest in sustainable packaging and build those additional costs into your menu pricing and phase in a new pricing strategy. And while sustainable packaging will impact your costs, here are a few tips on how to adjust your menu pricing to help counter those increases while not losing customers.",
                        "So what is sustainable packaging exactly? They’re products consisting of sustainable materials that can be reused, returned, or recycled.

It is protein-packed and ready to use across your menu, in tacos, meatloaves and other applications.

                        "This year, when seeking inspiration for your holiday menu, be bold. Start by looking around at on-trend international flavors such as Middle Eastern and Latin American to add panache to the celebrations. Festive should never mean flavorless. American chefs are fortunate—we don’t need to travel far to experience a variety of flavors and cultures. Both the United States and Canada have become delicious melting pots of global cuisines brought here by immigrants over the course of decades, from the Italian influence on the East Coast to the vast Chinatown offerings of Vancouver. In the festive dishes featured here, we look to other cultures to shake up the holiday menu and bring a cast of fresh ingredients into the mix. In Italian, Austrian and Portuguese dishes, seafood takes center stage, while in Latin America, mole is standard for celebrations. And in Seattle, a feast isn’t complete without salmon and local vegetables."

The best scallops in the country are fished right here, the same scallops we sell daily under Sysco’s Portico label.” During the holidays, families here serve beautiful seafood stews, such as the Portuguese Fish Stew, sometimes with linguica sausage, saffron broth and fresh herbs and garlic.",

But during the fall and winter months in Austria, Mandl says, you’ll find a variety of seafood on the menu, such as zander, Dover sole, trout and halibut.

The dishes vary, but one constant is baccalà, the Southern Italian dish of salt cod. Chef Nora Galdiano, Culinary Consultant at Sysco Central Florida, is herself an American immigrant— she was born in the Philippines but grew up in Hawaii. Growing up, Galdiano was exposed to lomi-lomi salmon, a cured fish dish similar to ceviche, which also inspired the salt cod portion of her Italian-style recipe for Herb-Crusted Cod Fillet and Poached Salt Cod."

Not surprisingly, the cultures and cuisine of El Paso and its neighboring cities are strongly influenced by Mexico and Latin America. “In a lot of households, you’ll find a mix of Mexican cuisines.” Pomales says. The Manchamantel sauce is a variation on a mole, which Pomales serves with a crispy pork belly. Traditionally, the festive, brightly colored sauce can take hours or even days to make. “I wanted to honor my culture but scale it down,” says Pomales. “Here, you take all the ingredients and throw them in the oven, then in the blender.” To make the dish less labor intensive, use precooked <strong>Sysco Classic Sous Vide Pork Belly</strong>.",
                        "Of all American cities, perhaps New Orleans has the richest culinary heritage. “I learned in culinary school, no matter where you go, there is always someone better with a knife or quicker in the kitchen, but they will never season food the way you do,  coming from New Orleans, says Chef Raymond Yakelis, Culinary Consultant at Sysco New Orleans.",
                        "What some may not realize is the extent to which New Orleans cooking has gone beyond gumbo and jambalaya to become a hub of international cuisine. “We have African, Creole, Vietnamese,  Hispanic—it’s a melting pot of flavors, and you can mold them all together  and make something great.” says Yakelis, who used on-trend Middle Eastern and Indian ingredients to create his Tandoori Rack of Lamb With Japanese Eggplant. “Rack of lamb is underutilized and has a wow factor when served,” says Yakelis."

                        "In the Pacific Northwest, the tradition of feasting goes back a long way. Before there was Thanksgiving, “Native American people of the Salish tribe celebrated the harvest by gathering wild vegetables, blackberries and the local abundance of salmon and shellfish,” says Chef Jeffrey Cox, Culinary Consultant at Sysco Seattle. Not only does this part of the country feature ample coastline, but it’s also fertile land for growing produce, which provided inspiration for Cox’s Salmon With Butternut Squash Casserole.",
                        "Each Christmas, Quebec is gilded with lights and carpeted in snow. Families gather to celebrate and indulge in holiday foods such as the traditional Québécois meat pie, the tourtière. “One of my favorite traditions is to gather together on Christmas Eve for my grandmother’s tourtière with homemade cranberry sauce,” says Chef Christopher Chabot, Sysco Calgary. “When I can’t get home for the holidays, I like to make a simpler, bite-sized version that I call Tourtière Turnovers.” They can be made and frozen weeks in advance, making them an easy addition to any holiday menu."

That increased consumer demand is having an impact on the market, including restaurant menus.

                        "“Most customers are looking for plates that go the extra mile,” says Chef Brian Dorsey, Culinary Consultant at Sysco Denver. “When you add something to a plate, don’t just do it because it looks pretty, but because it pulls the dish together, making it more flavorful and visually appealing.” For example, our Lemon and Thai Basil Blueberry Waffles, made with <strong>Sysco Classic Blueberry Muffin Batter</strong>, are topped with homemade preserves to more fully develop the blueberry flavor. The Thai basil, meanwhile, is an unexpected counterpoint. “It’s all about layering the flavors in interesting ways,” Dorsey says.",
                        "You can also elevate a dish by adding unusual, exotic or luxurious ingredients to the mix. Avocado toast is a simple concept, but one that continues to be reinvented by chefs—and enjoyed by diners—all across North America. Try adding not only rich smoked salmon to your avocado toast but also a hint of salty prosciutto to further set it apart."

But instead of topping them with the classics and stopping there, consider using them as the basis for a deluxe breakfast sandwich, as we’ve done with the Crab Cake Wafflewich. Not only does this plate reinvent the breakfast sandwich concept, but like the avocado toast, it also takes advantage of the current seafood trend, which is gracing breakfast menus across the country. Whether you mix smoked salmon or crabmeat into scrambled eggs or use smoked trout or lobster in a deluxe Benedict, seafood is a surefire way to elevate a morning dish and add value to the plate.",
                        "Another great idea for remaking the waffle—and layering flavors—is to stuff ingredients inside the batter before cooking instead of, and in addition to, placing them on top. This can be done using speed-scratch ingredients such as blueberry muffin batter or simply by adding the flavorings of your choice to <strong>Sysco Classic Waffle and Pancake Batter</strong>."

                        "Right now plant-based eating is the most talked about food trend—and it’s one that has stickiness. Plants are here to stay,” says Chef Neil Doherty, Sysco’s Senior Director of Culinary Development. “Consumers still want food that tastes good, but many are also looking for food to be their fuel. They want their food to provide nutrition for their body and they want to",
                        "be empowered with menu choices that support their personal sense of wellness—however they define it.” As more consumers go green and pile their plates with plants, Sysco saw the need to build more plant-based options into its assortment. “The launch of our new <strong>Sysco Simply</strong> brand is how we are going to support our customers with the plant-based products they need to bring variety and choice to their customers,” says Caitlin Armstrong, Brand Manager for Sysco Simply.",
                        "Vegetarian entrée options have always been based around vegetables and grains: stuffed squashes, tofu, pasta and rice dishes. Now consumers are also looking for plant-based proteins that have the taste, texture and satisfaction of meat. Sysco has responded to the market demand by developing the certified-vegan <strong>Sysco Simply Plant Based Meatless Burger Patty</strong>, which has a meatlike taste and texture and can be used in all of your favorite burger preparations. We have featured it here in the Feisty Feta and Avocado Burger (pictured). Another new alternative protein, <strong>Sysco Simply Plant Based Ground Bulk</strong>, has the same attributes as the burger and can be used for preparations such as tacos, vegan meatloaf or wherever you would normally use ground beef. Both products are gluten-free, dairy-free and non-GMO."

In fact, shrimp and many fin fish are known for providing a powerful punch of protein, without much saturated fat. Although shrimp and salmon reign as the most popular seafood among U.S. consumers, creative operators can also achieve great success by serving something slightly different, like a delicious grilled branzino with roasted beets or fillet of snapper rubbed with jerk spices.",

For example, elevate and lighten up a breakfast by replacing smoked meats with seafood. Smoked salmon makes a terrific substitute for ham or sausage, and also raises your check average by several dollars.",

He uses <strong>Sysco Imperial McCormick Pickling Spice</strong>, which is also an attractive option for less seasoned chefs because the spices, which help draw out the flavors of the vinegar and sugar mixture, are premixed. As for which vegetables to choose, Britten recommends that chefs pick the highest-quality seasonal produce in your local market."

When we were younger, we used to cook for the churches and for the homeless. This is something most of my family did.” India’s mother, April began to show her daughter how to cook at the age of seven. Later in life, India started to cook multi-generational Southern food recipes with her grandmother, Veronica. “She inspired me because I was raised by her, as well as my mom,” says India. A lot of times, my mom was working three jobs, so my grandmother had us a lot and showed me how to cook all the time.”",

Sunday dinners were a time for family to reconnect with one another over casserole dishes, and plates filled with generations of family recipes that held special memories. India recalls the immense joy that she felt seeing her family seated around the dinner table enjoying her grandmother’s food. The menu included items like scratch-made dumplings, fried chicken, yams, collard greens, black-eyed peas, and cornbread.",

The tremendous loss left a void in India’s life, and in the new restaurant that she was helping to build. Every sight and smell in the restaurant reminded India of her mother, and with the loss too great to bear, India decided to close V’s Kitchen indefinitely. After a few months of processing the new normal in a world without her mother, India decided to press forward and continue the work that she had started at V’s Kitchen. It’s what her mother would have wanted and what India knew she was meant to do.",

Although the address had changed, India was more committed than ever to cook from the heart and soul, just as her grandmother and mother had shown her over the years. “We have true soul food,” explains India. “In North Carolina, there’s barbecue spots that are really popular, but [there’s] not a lot of Southern food. I think with us being authentic, soul food, [made] fresh daily, that helps us stand out.”",
                        "Many of the items on the menu began as limited time specials, but have since become go-to favorites at the restaurant. “Our biggest item is oxtails,” says India. It was originally a special, but we ended up having to [offer it] daily. A lot of times oxtails are done Caribbean style, but we did a Southern twist where we cook it in gravy, and people ended up loving it. I didn’t think it would take off like it did.” Other popular menu items include the fried fish and shrimp, with delicious sides like three-cheese macaroni, collard greens, and cornbread."

                        "In the past four years, Richard Boston, India’s Sysco Consultant, has been there to support her every step of the way in her business. “He has turned into my friend,” says India. “I used to shop for myself, and he really showed me the convenience of [working with Sysco].” As Richard recalls, “When I first met India, I learned that she had been running to different big box stores to get all her groceries…in an effort to save money. [After] learning more about her need to control expenses I introduced her to Sysco mobile inventory. During the last 18 months, she used a [Sysco Solutions Partner POS system] to help her track orders, which also [resulted] in an increase of sales.”",
                        "Richard was on hand to support India as she reopened the restaurant after closing due to the Covid-19 pandemic. As Richard explains, “Around the end of July and the beginning of August, I reached out and was told that she wanted to try and reopen in September. She knew that everyone was working from home, but she wanted to take a step of faith and reopen for takeout only. I gave her information about other accounts in the area…to provide her with a better understanding of the current market.”During her reopening, India was given additional peace of mind that all her supply needs would be met by Sysco, despite nation-wide shortages on in-demand products. As India explains, “One thing that was big for me is a lot of times things were sold out, and I would hear about it, but I never had that issue with Sysco. [Things like] toilet tissue were always available.”",
                        "Now a decade after opening, V’s Kitchen is still going strong and serving the community of Durham. India’s biggest accomplishment to date is overcoming the most challenging aspect of running a business – getting started. “My biggest accomplishment would be [starting] the restaurant. [I’m proud of] the fact that I pushed through those first five years and made it because those were really hard. I can say I’m proud of myself for actually sticking through it. When I was younger, my mom used to tell me that I could do anything and that I should think bigger. So I think she’s instilled in me the thought that I should think more highly of myself… not just settle.”",
                        "The spirit of those Sunday dinners made by her grandmother lives on in every dish at V’s Kitchen. That same sense of love and legacy, family and fellowship, is extended to all customers that come into the restaurant. In V’s Kitchen, everyone comes as a guest and leaves as a friend."

                        "It all started with Mabel. The petite offset meat smoker designed by Texas native Chris Fultz could only feed so many people. This was back in 2013, when Fultz and partner Alex Graf began a pop-up barbecue operation in conjunction with the brewpub next door to their current restaurant.",
                        "The “Texas Trinity” of brisket, pork spareribs and sausage that Fultz and Graf were serving from Mabel became so popular that they first had to buy a bigger smoker, and next, in 2018, they opened ZZQ Texas Craft Barbeque, where they would have the chance to truly bring authentic Texas-style smoked meats to the Richmond community, which was generally more accustomed to pulled pork and mayo slaw.",
                        "“It’s been a fun opportunity to educate a lot of people about something they had never eaten before—which happens to be unbelievably delicious,” says Fultz. “In the beginning, the first thing I would hear from a customer was, ‘Can I have a barbecue sandwich?’ (And we do offer that, too.) But soon enough, brisket became our biggest seller.”",
                        "In addition to classic meats by the pound and a range of sandwiches, ZZQ also offers tempting sides such as jalapeño mac and cheese and Blackstrap collard greens. Desserts tend toward the sweet and Southern, such as banana pudding and peanut butter pie.",
                        "You can bet Daniel Vaughn, barbecue critic for Texas Monthly magazine, tasted a bit of everything when he came to visit ZZQ three or four months after it opened. “He came and sat in the backyard with his tray of food,” recounts Fultz. “And then <a href=https://www.texasmonthly.com/bbq/zzq/>he wrote this beautiful article about us</a>. Being a Texan and trying to bring this craft to the Mid-Atlantic—to get that kind of respect from my peers in Texas was huge.”",
                        "Great barbecue starts with the quality of the meat. “We buy all our proteins from Sysco and most of the produce and dry goods,” Fultz says. “Over the last three years, our Sysco Sales Consultant, Alex Filicko, and his team have been great about researching products—whether it’s pork or beef—and bringing us samples of products that are on the market. The beef we sell is all-natural, prime grade, with no hormones or antibiotics. We care about what goes on our customer’s plate.”",
                        "“If something goes wrong with a meat supplier, the Sysco team is in lockstep with us, helping us find a new supplier that meets our standards.”",
                        "Sysco has also been behind the scenes, helping ZZQ with special events such as one they held in fall of 2019 in the restaurant’s backyard. “Sysco provided some of the proteins for the event,” says Fultz, “and I stood up and said to all the guests, ‘You know, I can’t say enough positive things about Sysco and how well they’ve taken care of us from day one.’ Alex in particular is the boots on the ground. He’s here once or twice a week, checking on us, making sure everything’s OK. If anything’s wrong, he’s on it immediately.”",
                        "When COVID-19 hit, the team ZZQ team found themselves suddenly needing to change and change quickly. “I feel like Sysco did their part in keeping their eye out for us on product we might need that we’ve never even considered before,” says Graf, such as hand sanitizer and PPE.",
                        "First, ZZQ adapted by going to a system of phone orders with curbside pickup. After a mandatory shutdown and securing a PPP loan, they reopened with online ordering. At first, Graf was reluctant about the online innovation.",
                        "“I was against online ordering because part of the magic I see in what we do is in our serving line,” says Graf. “It’s that face-to-face interaction. The moment when the guest is maybe thinking they want a barbecue sandwich, and then we pull out a brisket and slap it on the cutting board right in front of them and it changes everything.”",
                        "They were surprised, however, to find that online ordering also has its benefits, too. “You see the customer’s name on the ticket,” says Fultz. “And a lot of these names are starting to come up over and over, week after week. These are our new regulars—and we are so grateful for them.”",
                        "In addition to online ordering, curbside pickup and backyard socially distant dining, the pandemic has pushed Fultz and Graf to embrace third-party delivery, but in a way that feels right for their brand.",
                        "“We were approached by a local bicycle courier, and it’s been a great partnership,” says Graf. “It’s been really successful, and it fits with who we want to be in the community.”",
                        "The team plans to stick with many of these innovations that were spurred by COVID-19 even after the pandemic is long gone. That includes staying with the “sold-out” 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. barbecue model, instead of going back to serving dinner as well.",
                        "“I think we will really stick to a true, sold-out model once we are able to open our serving line up again,” says Graf, adding that it will be better for both the business and their hardworking, scaled-down staff.",
                        "“One of the big lessons from an operating standpoint is that we’ve learned how to do more with less, do it more efficiently, and manage costs even more,” says Fultz. “And, most importantly, we’ve also been able to find a better balance between work and our life outside of these walls.”"

Today, the North Carolina–based company is the largest producer of turkey products in the U.S., processing more than 1 billion pounds of turkey annually. Sysco’s partnership with Butterball LLC has evolved over the past decade. “It’s been an increasingly strong relationship,” says Richie Jenkins, Senior Director of National Accounts and Marketing for Butterball Foodservice. “We’re approaching the business differently. Ten years ago, it was more transactional; now it’s more relational.”"

                        "The company focuses on reducing its environmental footprint by measuring everything from gas use to refrigeration. In the past, that monitoring has led Butterball to install LED lighting, which reduces electricity use, and to increase the amount of recycled water at company facilities.",
                        "Giving back to the community is another key component of Butterball’s mission. The company donates millions of pounds of food each year and supports many nonprofit organizations. “It’s great to be a good corporate citizen,” Jenkins says. “When someone sees the Butterball logo, there’s a connection between the brand and the holidays. Giving back is an extension of that—the holidays are about family, community and good feelings.”"

It’s a jump that’s also seen on the retail\nside—unsurprisingly, since one in three turkeys at Thanksgiving are Butterball\nbirds. “That’s our Super Bowl,” says Jenkins. “It’s our biggest time of the\nyear.”",
                        "Butterball provides Sysco with every- thing from ground turkey and turkey burgers to dark-meat items, like ham and pastrami, under the Sysco brand. It also supplies a variety of Butterball- andCarolina Turkeys–labeled products. “Pretty much anything there is to do with turkey, we’re doing with Sysco,” Jenkins says. “We’ve grown stronger together over time, and we’ll continue to deliver the products consumers crave.”",

                        "Redemption Bar and Grill is unlike any sports bar you have ever seen. In the summer of this year, the Utah-based business debuted to rave reviews for its unique style and give back initiatives. Jaime Ellison co-owns the restaurant with her husband, Bryan, and has a remarkable story behind the bar and grill’s name.",
                        "After exiting a prior business venture, the couple decided on a name that spoke to the spirit of optimism, hope, and tenacity that would be poured into their next business – “Redemption.” “Everybody needs redemption,” says Jaime. The couple was committed to making their next business bigger and better than the first and worthy of such an ambitious name.",
                        "Redemption Bar and Grill features a unique design concept where patrons can watch a game on one of three levels in the building, each with a distinct theme. The upper level and patio provide an island escape inspired by the owners’ fondness for the beach. “We are total beach people” declares Jaime. “We absolutely love the islands [and] we love to visit water stands, so that’s why we went with the upstairs theme. You could come and escape and feel like you’re really not in Utah. You’re kind of on vacation.”",
                        "The second level honors the courage and sacrifice of first responders and members of the military. Jaime explains, “we’re super big supporters of anybody [in the service], so we wanted to tie that into [the theme] and let those guys know that we appreciate [them].” Each table pays tribute to everyday heroes, from local law enforcement to service dogs that have been lost in the line of duty.",
                        "To give back to those who serve, patrons are encouraged to purchase a Redemption Challenge Coin for first-responders, veterans, and active-duty military members. The coin gives a service member $10 off of their meal, and patrons have the option to deliver the coins personally or anonymously by a staff member. The initiative is a show of gratitude to all who serve and offers Redemption patrons the chance to show kindness within their community.",
                        "The menu at Redemption is just as creative and eclectic as the design concept. “When we told people we’re opening a sports bar they said ‘oh, please don’t let it just be bar food.’ We got that a lot,” says Jaime. “We definitely [wanted] it to be unique. We wanted something different [from] burgers and fried food.” Their vision for an elevated menu has been realized through highly imaginative food items like the Peanut Butter Sriracha Burger – made with sriracha bacon, cheddar cheese, and peanut butter on a Tuscan bun.",
                        "Redemption’s Head Chef Cassie Busico’s influence has been an invaluable component of bringing their ambitious menu to life. As Redemption’s General Manager Keith Dean recalls, “Mark, [a Sysco Chef] and Cassie our chef… really spent hours upon hours together working on the menu and the sauces and tastes. They poured their hearts and souls into this.” Cassie’s culinary impact can be found in items like the American Dip that features in-house smoked brisket, an almost unheard of concept for a sports bar. Redemption also prides itself on offering high-quality food in ample portions. The Redemption club sandwich weighs in at nearly two pounds and is widely popular for obvious reasons.",
                        "Sysco team members supported the Redemption team every step of the way while developing their menu. “They played a huge role,” Jaime says when describing the role Sales Consultant Andrea Humphries and Sysco Chef Mark Smith played in crafting the menu. “You have to make your customer stand out and be unique,” Andrea explains. “To make that happen, you have to be all in with everything that Sysco offers from supplies to menu analysis, business reviews, and even working there if you have to.” Putting action behind those words, Chef Mark spent nearly four months on location while the menu was in development. Andrea and Chef Mark also worked closely with Redemption’s Manager, Brandie Savage. “Brandie has been there from the ground up,” says Andrea. In all the months that the menu was in development, Brandie never missed a chef’s meeting.",
                        "Redemption’s Head Chef Cassie also worked with Sysco’s Marketing Services team to design and develop various marketing materials such as the main menu and QR codes.  “[Sysco] worked endlessly to get us exactly what we had envisioned and more,” says Cassie. “The menu and flyers have been one less thing we have had to worry about in opening Redemption Bar and Grill and has helped immensely. In developing our QR codes for signage out front we have made it easier for customers to see our menus ahead of time which in turn helps with the turnaround in the kitchen. There have been many changes during this time with COVID, and [Sysco has] done everything to help us be successful in this business. Thank you for being a partner with us and all you have done to make this a profitable bar.”",
                        "Looking forward to the future, Jaime envisions multiple Redemption locations in the Utah area. Despite the challenges of being a new business and opening during a pandemic, the bar’s reception has been overwhelmingly positive. If you’re ever near Herriman, Utah, stop in to show your support. If you’re in need of redemption, be sure to purchase a Redemption Challenge Coin to show your gratitude to all who serve."

                        "Founded in 1934, Jimmy Kelly’s Steakhouse opened during The Great Depression and one year after the repeal of prohibition. As Mike Kelly describes, “My grandfather was the largest Bootlegger in the southeast. The US Congress in 1933 repealed prohibition, so his friend [suggested he] open a restaurant and sell whiskey there. That’s how we got started. When [my grandfather] opened the restaurant, he said, ‘give a man a generous pour of whiskey and a good steak and good service, and he’ll come back over and over again,’ so we kept that motto throughout our eighty-six years.”",
                        "Mike Kelly became the restaurant owner in 1982, taking the reins after his grandfather, father, and two uncles managed the business. Jimmy Kelly’s old-fashioned motto guides the values of quality food and exceptional service that have long been synonymous with the steakhouse. “We have an absolute tenacious pursuit of quality”, explains Mike. “That’s very important to us.",
                        "The connection between staff and management adds a layer of undeniable charm to the restaurant. As Mike explains, “We have an incredible staff. Many of them have been with us going on 40 years [and] a good deal of staff have been with us for 20 years. We’ve just got a family here. A lot of people use the word team, but most of my employees refer to it as a family – the Jimmy Kelly’s family.”"

That’s our driving force. It’s what we do when I unlock the door every day. For three generations of Nashvillians, this is the place where you celebrate babies, weddings, and anniversaries – even the passing away of someone in the family. People choose us, and that’s special.”",
                        "The menu at Jimmy Kelly’s Steakhouse offers Southern steakhouse classics made with fresh, quality ingredients. “We’ve definitely changed a lot of things over the years, but the core of our menu is still centered on steaks,” explains Mike. “We cut every steak that we serve [and] butcher in-house. It just goes a long way to help us retain quality. I’m very tenacious about the aging of our products. We serve aged beef and buy the very best products. We’re committed to freshness [and] work with our partners at Sysco to make sure that we can achieve that.”",
                        "Restaurant customers have their go-to favorites, but many entrees continue to be timeless classics. As Mike describes, “Our bone-in filet is certainly a show stopper. We [also] do a filet that we stuff with Maytag blue cheese and wrap it with Alan Benton’s hickory-smoked bacon that people really enjoy. We do fried oysters that people from Louisiana come here to eat, [and] during the summer months we [serve] homegrown tomatoes from a local farmer that lived next door to my grandfather for years. We bring that kind of freshness to the table.” Other exciting menu options include the Bootlegger’s Ribeye that features a chipotle hollandaise sauce, and Jimmy’s Cheeseburger made with aged tenderloin, ribeye, and sirloin steak, ground fresh daily."

                        "Jimmy Kelly’s Steakhouse was born in a time of uncertainty and has weathered many challenges throughout the years, but none like the unprecedented challenges of 2020. On March 2nd – 3rd, Nashville and surrounding areas were devastated by deadly tornadoes with winds above 175 mph. Hundreds of homes and businesses were destroyed, including the Sysco Nashville food distribution center. In a time of great uncertainty, Sysco’s sister operating sites jumped in with creative solutions to ensure that all customer orders would be fulfilled without disruption.",
                        "“Looking back on it, I think we were really spoiled to have such a large supplier here in Nashville available to us with such a big collection of [products],” Mike recalls. “We slugged through it – realizing where we were and knew that we were going to come back bigger and better than we were before. The Sysco team really jumped in and came up with a good plan to take care of their customers. I appreciate that and certainly would not have expected anything less. I knew they were going to do whatever they needed to do to make sure we were going to be able to open to serve our customers. It took a little more planning [and] trying to be nibble on our side, but our [Sysco Sales Associate] had to be nibble too, so I appreciate [everyone’s efforts]  in the midst of a major upheaval.”",
                        "Just days after the tornadoes swept through Nashville, the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic swept through the country. As Mike recalls, ” We were closed for five and a half months and opened back up the 1st of September when they eased a lot of restrictions and finally made it where we could at least try to be somewhat profitable. We’ve been real fortunate since that time [and have been]  awfully busy.”",
                        "From The Great Depression to natural disasters and an unprecedented pandemic, Jimmy Kelly’s Steakhouse has endured untold challenges throughout the years. Looking towards the year ahead, Mike and his team are excited to return to business as usual. As he explains, even though we’re in the middle of this [pandemic], the city is booming. I think the rest of the year is going to be really good for us.” This year the restaurant will celebrate eighty-six years in business, three generations of Kellys at the helm, and continuing the legacy of being one of Nashville’s most treasured icons."

For Mary, the promise of the American dream came with a sobering reality. “What was stopping me was I wasn’t legal at the time,” she explains. “Being at school [was challenging] because I knew I was not going to be able to go to college.” Feeling limitations from a lack of financial support and American citizenship, Mary abandoned the idea of higher education but never wavered on her dream to someday own a business.",
                        "At age fourteen, Mary’s life radically changed when she unexpectedly became pregnant. “Even though I was pregnant, I was still going to school,” she recalls. “I was [in school] and working at the same time, so I really learned a lot of things young. I knew I had more responsibility because I was going to have a child, so I doubled up on my [classes] to graduate early. I graduated [from high school] in three years instead of four – doing eleventh grade and twelfth grade at the same time. I was going to school from 6 am to 6 pm.”",
                        "In June 2012, Mary successfully graduated high school and continued to work throughout her pregnancy as a secretary at a local business. That same year she achieved another milestone by gaining her citizenship through the Obama Administration’s new Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. “That was the key to my future,” she proclaims. When I got it, I knew that I was going to have the future that I always wanted and always worked hard for. I [felt] like they’re giving me this opportunity [and] I’m not going to waste it! I’m going to keep working with this office, and I’m going to learn from the boss and get a lot of experience. My mentality was to [someday] have a business.”"

                        "In 2013 Mary became pregnant with her second child and decided that her life needed a drastic change if she hoped to become an entrepreneur someday. She decided to move to a new city to set her plan in motion to one day open a restaurant. Her husband, Lucio was reluctant to take the risk of relocating, so Mary took her children and the leap of faith to move all on her own. As she explains, “I had more responsibility, so I moved to Saint Paul’s by myself.” By age 19, she was tired of living paycheck to paycheck and wanted more for her family. Later that year, Mary began working at Mountaire Farms, a chicken products manufacturer. There, she promised herself that she would work for one year at the plant and then fully commit to opening her own restaurant. Little did she know, fate was about to send her the first of many signs that her dream restaurant was on the way.",
                        "“When I was moving [to Shannon], I saw the little location where my first restaurant is [now],” she explains. It was still occupied by the tenant. When I went there, I said to myself, ‘I wish that I had something like this. Something small that I can start and later on have something bigger.’ I prayed every day before going to work and every night before sleeping. I didn’t know how to start, [but] by the end of December, I drove by there, and the building was for rent! You know that feeling when you pray for something so badly, and it’s there for you? That’s [when I knew] this was mine!”",
                        "Although initially reluctant to take the chance on a business venture, Lucio eventually decided to take the journey with Mary and relocated to Shannon. Finances were tight as the couple balanced moving expenses, remodeling their new home, and Lucio transitioning into a new job. The couple didn’t have the start-up capital required to open the restaurant, but they remained hopeful, and more importantly, resourceful in making their dream a reality."

                        "By May 12th, 2015, Mary and Lucio had the keys to their first restaurant – Melecios Taqueria. As Mary explains, “We started remodeling with just a little paint inside. We didn’t have [much]. The little restaurant only had a grill and a deep fryer – that’s it. We didn’t have tables, booths, refrigerators, nothing.” Ever the resourceful optimist, Mary found gently used tables and chairs to furnish the restaurant and brought cookware from home to add to the kitchen. “I brought all my pots and pans from the house, my plates – everything came from the house. That’s how we started the first restaurant in Shannon. The first six months, we struggled because we really started from scratch.”",
                        "During that time, Mary used every bit of the business acumen that she had acquired throughout the years. Lucio added tremendous value to the business with his extensive experience in foodservice, including sixteen years as a cook. After Melecios Taqueria celebrated its second year of operation, the couple purchased a food truck. One year later, they were able to open their second restaurant located at 408 East 3rd Street in Pembroke, NC. As Mary explains, “We bought our own building here in Pembroke. We worked hard to buy a bigger location. We had nine tables [at the original restaurant], now we have 30 tables over here. When we completed four years, that’s when we opened the second location. It’s paid off, and I don’t have to worry about paying the rent anymore.”",
                        "Melecios Taqueria is where locals come for authentic Mexican cuisine. True to the flavors and ingredients used in traditional dishes from Mary’s homeland of Guerrero, Mexico, the menu serves an assortment of fresh-made spicy and satisfying dishes. “We have tamales that we make at least once a week,” she says. “They’re ready at eleven o’clock, and by three o’clock, they’re already gone. We make one-hundred-fifty to one hundred-eighty every day because we don’t want any to be leftovers. We make everything from scratch. We don’t buy anything [premade].”",
                        "Menu items include tacos made with an assortment of protein options that include grilled chicken, steak, marinated pork, tender pork, Mexican sausage, cow intestine, or beef tongue. The menu features familiar favorites like tacos, taquitos, and enchiladas, along with specialty items like the Molcajete, cooked with grilled chicken, steak, shrimp, chorizo fried green sauce, grilled onions, mushroom, and cactus.",
                        "Building her dream restaurant from the ground up was an arduous process, but Mary was able to depend on her Sysco Sales Consultant, Joe Knowles Jr., for guidance and moral support. “I started working with Sysco about three or four years ago,” she explains. “They’ve been so helpful, especially with opening the second location. My [Sales Consultant] Joe was really into helping me [and] trying to make sure that I had everything that I needed. He [put me in contact with] the people that help me order equipment, the food, everything. They helped me a lot.”"

                        "Lonnie Dutton is the founder and owner of Texas Cannon Brewing Company, a first-generation family-owned brewery and restaurant in Blanco, Texas. The name",
                        "Texas Cannon is inspired by the phrases “Texas Independence” and the “Come and Take it” Cannon – a symbol in the Texas Revolution. As Lonnie explains, “it represents Texas as a state, and the will of the people.” The brewery and restaurant offer patrons a warm and welcoming atmosphere filled with good company, great food, and craft beers infused with Texas pride.",
                        "Lonnie, a Texas native, got his first introduction to craft beers came in the 1980’s with Redhook ESB and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Years later, while touring a brewery in Delaware called Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, Lonnie found the inspiration that would one day change his life. “[On the tour] there was a system there called the Sabco BrewMagic,” he says. The system allowed employees to make small batches of beer that employees would sample and vote on their favorite brew. The beer that got the most votes had the honor of becoming a featured beer at the brewery. Intrigued by the idea, Lonnie took pictures of the Sabco BrewMagic with plans to purchase the brewing system for himself. Although a Texan native, Lonnie spent six years living in Pennsylvania for work. “When we moved back to Texas in 2017, I started looking for one of those systems,” says Lonnie. “I found one on Craigslist, bought it, and started home brewing.”"

                        "After weeks of online research and trial and error, Lonnie was ready to introduce his home-brewed beer to the world. “I started having beer parties at [my] house with friends and family,” he says. “People were like – ‘Man, this is really good beer, you could sell this stuff.’ So with their encouragement, me moving back to Texas, and [being close to retirement], I needed something to do.” That something would be launching Texas Cannon Brewing Company.",
                        "The brewery features a seven-barrel system, with each barrel holding thirty-one gallons of beer. That’s the equivalent of approximately 217 gallons of beer per batch. Lonnie purchases the grains used in his beers from Texas-based suppliers and gives each craft beer a name inspired by Texas history. One such beer is called the Six Pounder IPA – a reference to the weight of the cannonballs used during the Texas Revolution. Another beer, the Lost Leg Lager, is based on Santa Anna’s prosthetic leg taken by American soldiers. The brewery also serves wines produced in the Lone Star State. “All the wines we feature are Texas Craft wines with grapes that are from Texas,” he proclaims.",
                        "The food at Texas Cannon Brewing Company is inspired in part by the nostalgia of Lonnie’s childhood. “When I was a kid, my dad used to take us to a livestock auction, and they had a grill there,” he explains. “Those were my favorite hamburgers – straight off the grill, and a little grease on the buns. So that’s what I’m trying to do, just [provide] good ole “country food.” That good country includes classic American favorites like old fashioned burgers and hot wings, along with several innovative menu items inspired by the brewery itself. Lonnie explains, “When I was in PA they had crab fries, so we are doing a twist of those with our Gulf Coast Fries with an old bay seasoning and a beer cheese sauce. A lot of our recipes feature beers produced at the brewery.”",
                        "In launching Texas Cannon Brewery Company, Lonnie has realized his dream of creating a legacy for his family. “[A family-owned business] is something that I’ve always wanted to have,” he explains. “I’ve always worked for other people, and I want my kids and grandkids to have a family business.”",
                        "The first member of Lonnie’s family to join the business was his youngest daughter Stephanie. Her wealth of experience in the foodservice industry has been an invaluable asset to establishing her father’s business. “[Stefanie] is in the restaurant industry, so she’s worked with Sysco through various restaurants that she’s managed and operated,” says Lonnie. “She has been a good source of industry knowledge and introductions. One of those introductions was to our Chef Erika Stanley.” Stefanie now manages distribution and marketing, while Lonnie manages the brewery side of the business. Lonnie’s oldest daughter, Jennifer, came on as the Bar Manager, and his wife, Elaine, is the CFO of the business. Lonnie’s teenage grandchildren are also actively involved in the family business.",
                        "In December 2020, Texas Cannon Brewing Company opened with the help and support of Sysco team members. As Lonnie explains, “Sysco has been very instrumental in us opening and [our] success. They were the first vendor that we set up an account with, so they have been with us from the beginning.”"

We gave [Sysco] a concept of what we wanted with some of our food items, and they made them, let us sample them, and helped our chef develop recipes. Every week we get calls to see what else they can do for us to help us be successful.” Lonnie goes on to say, “[Keith has] invested time and effort [into] the success of our business. That’s what makes a good partnership. [Sysco doesn’t] just don’t provide food, you’re also invested in the success of the restaurant.”",
                        "Looking forward to the future, Lonnie hopes to collaborate with other community members to create a meaningful space for Blanco locals and tourists to enjoy. “We’re close to the [town] square, and we’re already working really well with three other small business owners [to]…open up a courtyard to be shared by the businesses and community. When we go to other places, that’s what we want to do, promote Texas, the local city and give back to the community.”",
                        "Lonnie has plans of bringing his love of Texas, good food, and quality craft beers into other Texas towns with satellite locations that offer the same food and atmosphere that he has cultivated in Blanco. “We’re in a small town here, and I want to branch out and do more of these same experiences in [other] small towns in Texas,” says Lonnie. “A lot of people focus on San Antonio, Austin, and [larger Texas cities], but I want to focus on these towns that have a pride in their community, in Texas and local craft brewery.”",
                        "Texas Cannon Brewing Company is a direct reflection of Lonnie’s core values of family and community. Beyond a love for craft beers, Lonnie’s love of people and state pride can be felt by all who come to know him. If you are ever in Blanco, Texas, stop by Texas Cannon Brewing Company and say hello to Lonnie and the family."

                        "Tupelo Honey Cafe was established in 2000 and purchased in 2008 by the current owner, Steve Frabitore. Soon after taking ownership, Frabitore expanded the restaurant into other cities across the Southeast. “The vision surrounding that growth was fresh-made responsibly sourced Southern food for the world, explains Caitlin McMahon, VP of Supply Chain at Tupelo Honey. “The more we expand outside of the Southeast, the more we learn what a hunger there is for that Southern, ‘come together over comfort food’ vibe that we offer.”",
                        "As new Tupelo Honey locations emerged, regional favorites were added to the menu to appeal to the community, however, the restaurant’s classic Southern comforts were always in high demand. As McMahon explains, “When we first expanded out west into places like Texas where beef is king, we added a lot more beef on the menu, and it turns out that people still wanted to buy fried chicken from us. The more we expanded, the more we learned that the best thing that we could do is be true to our core.” The menu changes with the seasons, offering diners the very best that nature has to offer. The Tupelo Honey menu changes with the seasons, and features Southern comforts, made in-house.",
                        "Customer favorites include the restaurant’s claim to fame – Tupelo’s Honey-Dusted Fried Chicken made with all-natural chicken. Other popular menu items include fried green tomatoes, stone-ground grits, and sweet potato pancakes made with roasted sweet potatoes mixed into the pancake batter. No true southern restaurant could leave biscuits off the menu, and at Tupelo Honey, the biscuits are unforgettable! Made in-house from scratch using simple ingredients, the biscuits are baked to perfection daily, and served with blueberry jam and whipped butter."

As McMahon explains, “My role is supply chain, and that matters a lot to me. I have made it my entire career at Tupelo to constantly seek out products that we’re proud of. Every piece of seafood inside Tupelo Honey is sustainably farmed or sustainably wild-caught.” Other proteins served at the restaurant are sourced from humanely-raised farms that provide antibiotic and hormone-free animal products. “[We are] always trying to find ways to improve to be good stewards of the food systems,” says McMahon.",
                        "Sysco is a proud partner in helping Tupelo Honey consciously serve fresh, quality food all across America. As McMahon describes,” The thing that I think sets Tupelo apart as a restaurant group is our commitment to quality products. I was [initially] concerned about buying from Sysco, and what that means for the quality of our ingredients and impact on the food system in this country, [but] it was the right thing to do to establish a relationship with Sysco.” As the restaurant group expands, McMahon knows that she can depend on Sysco’s fresh, quality food products to meet the high standards and values that have laid the foundation for Tupelo Honey’s ongoing success. She goes on to explain, “Lauren, my [Sysco] Sales Consultant, the VP of Sales [ and others] have really impressed me with their candid, open-minded problem solving that you might not expect at a company of this size.”",
                        "Tupelo Honey is equally as invested in the well-being of the environment as they are to their communities and staff. In response to the devastating economic impact that the pandemic had on the foodservice industry, in May of 2020, Tupelo Honey launched the Biscuits for a Cause Relief Fund As McMahon describes, “We made a decision to take care of our team members by switching up the way we offer biscuits. Now all of our biscuits are [part of] Biscuits for a Cause. After we recover our costs, one-hundred percent of the profits go to an employee relief program and an aspire program – a scholarship and diversity and inclusion initiative. We are so proud that biscuits, the staple of Tupelo Honey, are funding great causes for our team.”",
                        "In two decades, Tupelo Honey has expanded into seventeen operating locations, including Milwaukee, Wisconsin, due to open in the coming weeks. The heart and soul of the restaurant lies in serving quality meals while continually striving to explore food purveyors and opportunities that support a more sustainable food group. Great food and a great cause are everything sweet about Tupelo Honey."

It’s right in front of the pier in Avila Beach, so it’s perfect for families.<strong>Ventana Grill</strong> was our second opening. The views are majestic: pristine coastline, very rustic and rocky. It has an eclectic feel—Latin fusion with some California cuisine and plenty of seafood, which is important at all of our concepts. The restaurants are on the coast, and seafood is what guests are often looking for.<strong>Wooly’s Beach Bar & Grill</strong> in Pismo Beach is named for the president of our company, Mark Woolpert. He’s a surfer and a local. The restaurant is all about grabbing a beer, watching the surfers and having some good grub.",

Jared Hurst is the chef; his food has a lot of Asian influence, but there’s a little bit of French and a little bit of American in there, too. It’s dinner only, so it offers a fine dining experience with a casual, beachy feel.",

                        "Edley’s Bar-B-Que is more than a neighborhood restaurant, it’s a family legacy. When Will Newman opened the business, he set out to create a place that emulated his grandfather’s love of people, family, and community. Chris Beckler, the President at the restaurant, explains, “[Edley] had a history of giving and caring in the community. That’s really what Will wanted to name the restaurant after.”",
                        "Edley’s Bar-B-Que has four locations throughout Tennessee, a far cry from the premier restaurant that opened on a lonely block in the neighborhood of 12 South. “[Back] then Edley’s was one of the first and only things on the street,” says Beckler. “There wasn’t a whole lot around. Today it’s a good retail and restaurant area where a lot of folks come to visit. [Now] it’s a destination area.” Edley’s Bar-B-Que hosts guests in a welcoming atmosphere with exceptional service. Many team members have been with the restaurant for years and call Edley’s Bar-B-Que a second home, and see fellow team members and guests as extended family.",
                        "The standards for excellence are high at the restaurant, and evident in the award-winning menu. Tennessee is best known for pork barbecue, but as Beckler explains, their top-selling beef brisket provided tourists and locals alike an exciting alternative. “We’re one of the few places in Tennessee that use prime grade brisket. It is a premium brisket product that we use that a lot of the places don’t.” Meats at the restaurant are smoked fresh daily, low and slow over White Oak wood to create a flavor that guests crave.",
                        "Edley’s Bar-B-Que has perfected a highly desirable menu of side items that are just as noteworthy as its smoked meats. Beckler explains, “We put as much time and energy in our sides as we do our meats. All of our sides are scratch-made daily.” One of the shining stars on the side menu is the mac and cheese. “We do our mac and cheese with a smoked Gouda and a little bit of nutmeg, so it’s got a little bit of a different taste than your typical mac and cheese,” says Beckler. “It [has] four cheeses, and the rue takes three to four hours to [make].” Another popular side item are green beans made with a homemade bone broth that is unique to the restaurant. Customers can also order banana pudding as a side item versus a dessert option."

                        "When owner Will Newman established the restaurant in honor of his grandfather, Edley, he sought to build a business that exemplified the generosity, hard work, and Southern hospitality that his grandfather instilled in him. Those driving principles were on full display in the days that followed the devastation that Tennesseans experienced in the spring of 2020. On March 2nd – 3rd, Nashville and surrounding areas were devastated by deadly tornadoes that unleashed winds above 175 mph. Despite the trail of destruction that stretched for miles, the community rallied together, and businesses like Edley’s Bar-B-Que were there to uplift the community in their time of need.",
                        "As Beckler recalls, “I’ve seen a lot of disasters. I’ve had restaurants in Jackson, Mississippi during Katrina, and I’ve been in earthquakes in California… but I had never seen a community rally around each other like I did in Nashville, Tennessee, a year ago.  You couldn’t get through the neighborhood because there were so many volunteers there with brooms and shovels, just picking up debris and helping each other. It was amazing! We wanted to give back as well, so we set up a smoker out on the street because our restaurant wasn’t open, and handed out free pork sandwiches to anyone that needed it. There’s a lot of folks that didn’t know where they were going to sleep at night. We know we’re part of every community we’re in, and we want to make sure that we’re partnering with that community when times are tough.”",
                        "Like other homes and businesses in the area, the Sysco food distribution center in Nashville was completely devastated – disrupting the supply chain to Sysco customers like Edley’s Bar-B-Que. “I’m sure they had thousands, or even millions of dollars of food and products in their warehouse that was no longer accessible to all the restaurants around Nashville, and obviously themselves,” says Beckler. In a time of great uncertainty, Sysco’s sister operating sites jumped in to help service Tennessee customers impacted by the tornados.",
                        "“They struggled, but while that was going on, they could not have been more supportive of what we were trying to do,” Beckler recalls. “They’re devastated and trying to figure out where in the heck they’re going to get food from, and at the same time… [Brian Stover], who’s our Sysco Representative, was immediately ready to help. We were donating to folks the pork sandwiches, and Sysco got us the pork. They got it donated, they worked to get chips and waters, and they had people from their company come out and help us hand them out. It was amazing! I’ve been in the business quite a while, [about] 25-30 years. One thing I’ve learned over time is that you thrive and succeed based on your partnerships, who you work with, and how [you] support others. People’s character is revealed when times are tough.”"

As Beckler describes, “About two weeks [after the tornados], the Covid pandemic hit, and none of us knew what was going to happen. I’ve been part of bigger groups that have a hundred restaurants that can withstand things, but when you have five to seven, every dollar counts. It’s personal at that point, so it’s hard to withstand those types of challenges. We didn’t know if we were going to be in business…we didn’t know what was going to happen.”",
                        "Despite the devastation at the Sysco Operating center in Nashville, customers like Edley’s Bar-B-Que received the support they needed to survive during the pandemic. As Beckler recalls, “[We told] Troy Edwards, who was leading the branch of Sysco at the time [that we] needed help. He went out of his way to make sure we got everything we needed.” To support the restaurant, several allowances were made to help customers, including the extension on payment terms for invoices.",
                        "“Those guys jumped through hoops for us, Brian in particular,” says Beckler. “They had no food for us, and we have a lot of specialty meats like pork that’s brought in specifically for us, brisket, and so on, and he did whatever it took. He was on the phone with me just about every couple of hours sourcing food for us and bringing it in on refrigerated trucks, and parking it in our parking lot from other places. While all this was going on…we didn’t lose one item on our menu because they made sure we had it all. It was amazing. We survived and came out of this strong.”",
                        "Despite the odds and unprecedented challenges, Edley’s Bar-B-Que will soon be celebrating their 10-year anniversary and all the joy and memories they’ve brought to their Tennessee community. “One of the things we learned this year is just how mentally tough and full of grit we are,” says Beckler. “We were able to adapt ourselves and our business to changing consumer demands.”"

                        "Looking forward to the future, the restaurant has plans that will possibly revolutionize barbecue as we know it. “We’re innovating a new Nashville-style of barbecue,” explains Beckler. “We’re trying to create a new category. Many people know Nashville’s hot chicken, so we’re taking the concept of Nashville chicken and merging it with pork, so it’s a barbecue style that’s full of flavor and has a little bit of a kick. It’s something we’re wanting to be known for.”",
                        "Beckler and other businesses in the area are also looking forward to a safe return to normalcy in the year ahead, and the reemergence of travel across the country. “What we’re looking forward to is seeing people coming to town again,” he says. “We don’t ever want to lose that neighborhood vibe, and the sense of community that we have, but if we can add some folks coming in from out of town on top of that, that would be really big.”",
                        "Just as Edley Newman lived his life with great love for family, friends, and community, his grandson is now continuing his legacy through the restaurant that bears his name. In the tough times and the good, Edley’s Bar-B-Que has shown its commitment to developing strong community roots with purpose, partnerships, and a passion for people. Beckler says it best – “If you have a reputation for being good, and doing good things, that’s going to pay off for you. This is a relationship business. The more you are able to build relationships based on a great reputation, the better off you’ll be."

That first location was a success, and from there, we created the restaurant group 110 Grill. Since then, we have opened 21 additional locations all around New England and New York.

                        "Midtown Tavern is the latest in a series of businesses launched by Susan and Gennaro. As Susan explains, “We’ve had a bunch of restaurants in Raleigh. We had an alehouse, sushi restaurant, pizzeria, and then over here [in Charlotte] nightclubs. Everything we open is a little bit different.” Midtown Tavern opened on June 4th, 2020, after a four-month delay due to Covid-related dine-in restrictions. “We were supposed to open in March, but you couldn’t dine in, so we didn’t want to open and just showcase our food for takeout,” says Susan. “We waited until we were allowed at least fifty percent occupancy, and then we opened.”",
                        "Midtown Tavern prides itself on providing fresh, quality food in what Susan describes as an “upscale but casual bar atmosphere.” The restaurant offers patrons a rustic vibe with two outdoor patio options for dining al fresco. “We have two patios – one’s covered, and the other has open air,” describes Susan. “We also have… two bars – the main bar, and then the lounge patio bar [where] we also have DJs and bands.”",
                        "The eclectic menu at Midtown Tavern features familiar bar food favorites along with an assortment of unique options. Nearly everything served is made in-house using fresh, quality ingredients that elevate the flavors in every dish. “It looks like a normal menu… but everything’s pretty much made in-house,” describes Susan. “All of our sauces and all of our dressings are all homemade. We make fresh mozzarella from curd, the pizza sauce, everything.”",
                        "The restaurant serves appetizers like lobster tater tots, gourmet salads, wraps, wood-fired pizzas, and burgers like the Guinness burger made with Angus beef. Options like the chicken masala and Korean glazed salmon bring international flavors to the menu. Guests also have a wealth of vegetarian options like the widely popular avocado rolls or Asian fried cauliflower tossed in a sweet and spicy barbecue sauce. Midtown Tavern proudly serves an extensive drink menu that includes local North Carolina beers on draft alongside specialty cocktails and martinis."

                        "In 2020, the pandemic disrupted every aspect of daily life across the country and created unique challenges for new businesses like Midtown Tavern. Sysco Sales Consultant Lauren Iazzetti supported Susan as she navigated her way through Covid-related restrictions, mandates, and safety protocols. As Susan explains, “Whether she’s working or not, she’s always working. She always makes [any] situation work. She’s helped out with things that a normal rep wouldn’t. She’s an above and beyond [type] person.” For added safety and convenience, Sysco provided Susan with contactless menu solutions by adding QR codes to the tables to allow customers to access the menu directly from their smartphones.",
                        "Despite the obstacles along the way, Susan’s tireless commitment to her business and resilient work ethic have helped Midtown Tavern generate rave reviews for quality food and exceptional service. “I make it happen,” she says. “I’m a strong independent person [that is] good in high-stress environments and not letting it show.” This year, she is looking forward to expanding business hours and opening the restaurant to full capacity. “We stopped doing nighttime events with the band because of the 11 o’clock alcohol curfew [in Charlotte], so we’re looking forward to getting back into the late-night events,” she says.",
                        "Beyond being an accomplished business owner, Susan has a heart for guiding aspiring female entrepreneurs through the journey of business ownership. “It is a great opportunity to instill my knowledge and experience to other women,” she explains. Susan believes in leading by example to empower her staff to be the best version of themselves – whether they work at Midtown Tavern or choose to open their own business someday.",
                        "If you are ever in Charlotte, be sure to stop by Midtown Tavern for a refreshing cocktail, a fresh-made meal, and music on the patio."

                        "Since 1979, Sweet Street has produced on-trend gourmet desserts that not only taste great but are also made with clean ingredients. Considering the company’s success, it’s hard to imagine that founder and CEO Sandy Solmon, once a photographer, had not planned to join the food business.   But after moving from Berkeley, California, to Reading, Pennsylvania, Solmon found the industry was a natural fit. “I understood intuitively that food was the glue that got us all to pause and talk to each other, and I love those moments of community and conversation,” she says.",
                        "Today, Sweet Street makes more than 300 desserts, from layer cakes and cheesecakes to bars and cookies. A shared love of delivering quality and flavor, focusing on innovation, and anticipating the market has helped Sysco and Sweet Street maintain a successful partnership for more than 10 years. “Both companies are committed to growing the dessert assortment, delighting our customers and making it profitable and successful for those mutual customers,” says Solmon."

It’s certainly cultivated a different bond between us, because innovation is where Sweet Street shines,” says Solmon. The resulting <strong>Luscious Layers</strong> cake line features cheesecakes and layer cakes that look and taste great. “I would put the <strong>Banana Toffee Bourbon Cake</strong> up there as one of our masterpieces,” Solmon says."

For forty years, the couple owned several restaurants in upstate New York and the Bronx before settling into retirement in Florida.

As Lucy describes, “We felt that there was a need in North Carolina for this type of business that we’re doing, and [so far] we’ve gotten such a great [response]. People love us, and we just opened four and a half months ago. It’s been so busy [despite] Covid and all. It was almost like people were waiting for something like this.”",

As Lucy describes, “When people come in here, they tell us ‘I feel like I’m at home.’ We feel the same way about the customers. We love that they come in and enjoy what they’re eating [while] we get to know them by name. A few of them I know by what they order [ when they call]. That’s important to people to know that you care about them as an individual [and it’s] not just about their money.”"

We make one sauce specifically for parmesan [dishes] like chicken, veal, and eggplant parmesan. When it comes to seafood, we use a marinara that we make with garlic and fresh parsley because that tends to go really well with the seafood. You don’t find many places going out of their way to make a specific sauce just for [each dish]. Everyone’s raves about the sauces.”",

The pizza inspired by Lucy – Lucy’s Fresh Tomato comes topped with mozzarella, sliced fresh tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, basil, and spices with no sauce. Other menu offerings include appetizers, soups, calzones, heroes, and entrees like Chicken Francese and stuffed veal parmigiana."

                        "Opening a new business has its challenges, especially during a global pandemic. After Vic and Lucy purchased the restaurant, they quickly realized that the space needed renovations. As Sysco Sales Consultant Richard Boston recalls, “Shortly after Vic and Lucy acquired the restaurant, they began the remodeling process, and I was there to help them locate high-quality equipment. I worked with our Supplies on the Fly specialist to get them new tables, chairs, cooking equipment, and supplies.”",
                        "To ensure the success of the business, Richard went beyond fulfilling supply needs and weekly check-ins. “Once during my weekly visit, I was informed by Lucy that they needed to be ServSafe certified within six weeks,” says Richard. “I coordinated with our IFSO partners on getting a training date set up for both to attend. I assisted them with acquiring study materials and offered help with their studies.” In the weeks leading up to the exam, Richards played the role of Sales Consultant/study buddy to help Lucy pass the certification exam. “We love Richard,” says Lucy. “He really cares [and] goes out of his way.”",
                        "Vic and Lucy are dedicated to giving back to charitable organizations in support of their new community. In 2020 they donated to the viral fundraiser, Barstool Fund, which supports small businesses impacted by the pandemic. The American Cancer Society is another organization near and dear to their hearts. “I personally had cancer three times, and I really like to do something to give back, says Lucy. “I’m a survivor, and I’m grateful so those are the things that we’re looking forward to doing this year.”",
                        "In the months ahead, Mezza Luna customers can expect to see new dessert specials added to the menu. “We sell so many cannolis because we make our own cannoli cream,” Lucy explains. “Last week, my husband [introduced] an amazing tiramisu. We didn’t think that we were going to sell that much, but the whole tray went in two days. We had to go ahead and make another one.”",
                        "Mezza Luna may be new to Apex, North Carolina, but the restaurant that first began in New York, by way of Italy, has decades of tradition behind it. The recipe for their sauce might be a secret, but the word is out that Mezza Luna is quickly becoming one of North Carolina’s must-try pizza restaurants. If you’re ever in the area, be sure to stop in. Buon Appetito!"

That first year is when we debuted the milkshakes, and things went nuts from there. Since that first Bocas House opened in Weston, we have opened one in Doral and our biggest location in Coral Gables. Altogether, now there are three Bocas Houses, three Bocas Grills and two Bocas Grill & Bars."

                        "For Chef Tse (pronounced “Say”), her culinary career began where her corporate career ended. After 12 years in corporate marketing for some of the country’s largest companies, she was left uninspired and in need of a change. “I woke up one morning and realized my heart wasn’t in my job,” she recalls. “I decided to quit my job and go to culinary school. I took a leap of faith and enrolled at Le Cordon Bleu Paris.” The following day, her enrollment application was accepted, and six months later, she was packing for France.",
                        "While studying at Le Cordon Bleu Paris, Tse studied pastry and cuisine, finishing first in her class in both disciplines. To apply her skills, she went to work in one of the most highly esteemed restaurants in Paris. “I found myself at Le Restaurant Guy Savoy, a three Michelin starred restaurant, and at the time, one of the top 50 [restaurants] in the world.” The internship was a grueling process complete with sore feet, thirteen-hour days, sweat-drenched chef coats, and being shouted at in French. The experience was challenging yet rewarding. One of those rewards was meeting her husband.",
                        "After her internship ended, Tse went on to work as a pastry chef at Pierre Herme – named after the famous French pastry chef and chocolatier. She recalls, “[while] there we made entremets (cakes), pastries and of course macarons. Macarons are my personal favorite, and we’d do about 5,000 of them in one shift.” After learning all that she could in Paris, Tse returned to the U.S. and began to share her newfound passion for food with others.",
                        "She became the Healthy Cooking Ambassador for Regence BlueCross BlueShield. “[We] created healthy cooking classes, filmed a series of videos for YouTube, wrote articles, and appeared on TV,” she says. “All in the name of good health!” The platform was a perfect vehicle for Tse’s engaging personality and passion for food. “I have a love affair with food – one that goes beyond lifting a fork to my lips,” she explains. Before long, a prominent figure in the Portland food scene noticed her talent and encouraged Tse to teach the two things she knew best – the culinary arts and marketing.",
                        "“I met Cory Schreiber, one of the founding chefs of the Portland restaurant scene, and he suggested [that] I start teaching students. I started teaching culinary [skills] and marketing as an adjunct instructor at The Art Institute and soon learned teaching was my passion,” says Tse. She eventually moved on to teach full time at Le Cordon Bleu Portland, before taking a chef instructor position at Oregon Culinary Institute. In 2019 Cory Schreiber reached out to Tse once more, this time to ask if she would be interested in working for Sysco. “When your mentor calls you and asks you a question like that, you say ‘YES’!” she proclaims. For just over a year now, Chef Tse has been a proud Sysco Culinary Consultant.",
                        "She offers Sysco customers a wealth of knowledge and the benefit of her culinary style and philosophy. “I prefer to cook simply with really good ingredients,” she says. “I’m a huge fan of supporting local farmers and choosing seasonal products.” Tse is inspired by the food ingredients found in her home state. She explains – “Oregon has such a bounty of amazing ingredients: huckleberries from the mountains, salmon from the ocean and rivers, wild mushrooms from the forests. It’s like a chef’s dream!”",
                        "Beyond culinary expertise, Chef Tse is a wealth of wisdom and encouragement for Sysco customers. “I truly care about each and every [customer] and just want to see them succeed,” she explains. That support is essential as the foodservice industry responds to the global health crisis. “Focusing on keeping our customers open and helping them develop new strategies is paramount to the success of this industry.” She is passionate about supporting farmers during this challenging time. “We need to support more local farmers. They are a huge resource in our community, and by buying from them, we keep our economies healthy.”",
                        "The journey from corporate marketing to culinary consultant has not been comfortable, but it has been fulfilling. Chef Tse is no stranger to challenge, and now she hopes to encourage others in the foodservice industry to preserve during this time of uncertainty. “Do not give up! This is probably one of the most important and most difficult times in our industry. We need to come together, dig down deep, and find creative ways to keep ourselves afloat. Even though the situation looks grim, there are many glimmers of hope. Find a mentor in the industry and keep marching forward!”"

                        "Chef Mark Sierra is a proud veteran and owner of Compadres Hill Country Cocina in Boerne, Texas. The Tex-Mex restaurant opened in June of this year and has already become a destination location for diners across Texas. The restaurant has even drawn celebrities like legendary country singer George Strait. As 2020 proves to be a challenging year for most restaurants, the pandemic set in motion the very series of events that would lead to Compadres’ creation.",
                        "Chef Mark first learned his way around the kitchen at the age of ten. His grandmother had gone blind due to a medical condition and required care from a hospice nurse. To her dismay, the nurse refused to prepare meals for Mark. “My grandmother got upset and said, ‘You know what? We don’t need her here. I’m blind, but I’m gonna teach you how to cook right so we can cook for all of us,’ ” Mark recalls. From that point on, his grandmother used her remaining senses to teach her grandson how to prepare food – from picking the best produce to seasoning in the right proportions",
                        "Food and family shaped much of Mark’s childhood as his Mexican heritage was shared through cooking. “We always had family, and we always had food,” he recalls. “I was always in the kitchen watching, eating, and picking off of [food]. My cousins and uncles were very old school traditional ranchers, and for the holidays, we’d slaughter pigs, skin them [and] make barbacoa. That level of cooking was always with me.”",
                        "Mark took on various positions in the foodservice industry until, at the age of 27, he decided to join the army as a Fire Support Specialist. “We were forward observers,” says Mark. “Basically, we go in and do any kind of reconnaissance scouting. If there were any threats or anything that we had to eliminate, we’d call in for air strikes or mortars or artillery.” Even on foreign soil, Mark used food to bring his brothers in arms together as he grilled burgers and ribs to boost morale and give the soldiers a taste of home. “When I cook, I literally feel like I’m cooking every day for my family because that’s what I do,” he explains. “I cook just like we did back home, and it brings people together.”",
                        "Mark left the army in 2011 after two tours of duty in Iraq. A year later, he enrolled in Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts in Dallas, Texas. Shortly after graduation, Chef Mark began his professional culinary career as an Executive Chef in Uptown Dallas, before opening a cafe in his hometown of La Joya, Texas. After closing the cafe, Chef Mark became the Executive Chef at the Fair Oaks Country Club, where he worked for almost three years before being furloughed this year due to the pandemic.",
                        "“I decided, ‘You know what,’ instead of just sitting around, I’m not trying to get [another] job anywhere else where I have to start from the bottom,” he recalls. “I worked [hard] to get where I [am], and I’m not going backward.” With just $390 in the bank, Mark and his wife took their future into their own hands and started selling homemade soups and salsas. “I cooked all night and delivered all-day,” says Mark. Eventually, he was able to afford a smoker and host pop-ups, ironically not too far from his former employer.",
                        "A few months later, Chef Mike and his wife opened Compadres Hill Country Cocina. “We sell out daily,” he explains. “We’re going over 450 pounds of beef fajita a week, and we’re only open for lunch. It’s crazy because we just go from 11 am until we run out. We try to go until 4 pm, but that never happens. [On the] weekends lines are out the door. People are already here, just waiting outside.”",
                        "Since opening day, Sysco has been a part of Compadres, and is proud to support the veteran-owned business. “Sysco played a big part in helping me out when we first started,” Mark recalls. “They had this program where there was a startup account to help out small businesses.” The line of credit offered by Sysco was vital to Chef Mark, especially as a new restaurant owner facing the uncertainty of a pandemic. Mark goes on to say, “[the funds] helped out with our first order. [Sysco does] a lot for us; they’re really good people.” As luck would have it, Mark also works with a Sysco Sales rep that he initially met six years ago and is excited to be working with him again.",
                        "Mark’s commitment to supporting veterans is evident in nearly every aspect of his restaurant, from the decor to rituals that honor those who have served. “We got flags hanging everywhere, [and] pictures from veterans that come in… to honor them.” Every Friday at noon, the restaurant has a tradition of pausing while the national anthem is played.  Mark explains – “I have a 76-year-old retired army veteran that comes in and stands right in the front door, and I stop all operations and make the announcement to have everyone on their feet [for the national anthem].”",
                        "Chef Mark credits his military training with influencing his entrepreneurial style and commitment of service to others. “It’s [about] work ethic. It’s [about] selflessness,” he declares. “That’s what we’re all about, and that’s what we’re taught. Being a veteran business owner I hope to inspire veterans to go out there and not be afraid to take a chance. I would have never imagined this.”"

Vivid memories of growing up in the kitchen with his mother, a home economics teacher, and grandmother, laid the foundation for his future in culinary pursuits. “My earliest food memory is with my grandmother, Mama Lile”, he recalls. “She was by the stove, and I was running and playing around the house. I would do pit stops by the kitchen so she could feed me little handfuls of ‘pegao’ – the crispy rice on the bottom of the pot.”",

However, after working in a bakery, he felt redirected back into the embrace of the culinary world. “I enrolled in Florida Culinary Institute and moved to West Palm Beach, Florida with 900 dollars in my pocket, a suitcase on my hand, and priceless dreams in my heart”, he recalls. Those dreams motivated Chef Luis while enduring a grueling schedule of attending culinary school by day and working in restaurants by night. By graduation, he had mastered not only the culinary arts but the art of perseverance. As Chef Luis would tell an aspiring chef, “stay true to yourselves! Throughout your career you will develop…but your core should always be there”."

                        "Originally from the countryside of Vietnam, Kim’s family relocated to Houston, Texas while she and her sister Ky were young children. Kim experienced a multitude of cuisines while living in the fourth largest city in the country, but Cajun food – most notably seafood boils, made the biggest impression on her. In 1996 the family relocated to San Diego, where Kim’s parents opened a small restaurant in El Cajon city serving carryout Chinese and Vietnamese food.",
                        "The sisters worked at their parent’s restaurant for years and witnessed firsthand the grueling hours, physical demands, and challenges of managing the business.To help their parents retire after years of dedication and hard work, the sisters decided to open their own restaurant along with Kim’s now-husband Quan. In 2007, despite being young and lacking the funds to open a business, Kim, Ky, and Quan opened the very first Crab Hut in the Kearny Mesa area. As Kim explains, “We happened to come across this restaurant where my dad used to work. They said they were looking to sell the restaurant, and so we bought it.” Quan worked on the construction and design, Ky worked on the recipes and menu, while Kim managed the finances and administrative tasks of the business.",
                        "Within a month of opening Crab Hut, the restaurant was a success! “[When] we jumped into this, our only hope was to help our parents retire… and then we’d move onto something else,” Kim recalls. “The success of the first location was actually overwhelming. Back then, there was no social media, but word got out. At that time, Asian Cajun was really hot, so when they heard that there is something like that opening up in San Diego, we had long lines waiting for us [up to] three hours before we opened.” In 2010 a second Crab Hut location opened in downtown San Diego, and in 2016 a third location opened its doors in the Mira Mesa neighborhood."

                        "Crab Hut is known as the only Southern seafood boil restaurant in San Diego with a craft cocktail menu. “When we first started out, we were known as the “crawfish boil” restaurant,” explains Kim. “Eventually we changed that image into a “Southern seafood boil” restaurant, and focused on our bar.”",
                        "The menu at Crab Hut features fresh, quality ingredients that are locally sourced as often as possible. “We pick the best of the best for our ingredients,” says Kim. From crab legs to lobster, boiled shrimp to crawfish, the menu has something to satisfy the diverse cravings of the Crab Hut customer base. As Kim explains, “Our original location sells a lot more crawfish. In our downtown location, we sell more king crab legs and lobster, and in our newest location near Mesa, we sell a lot of Dungeness crabs and shrimp.”",
                        "The cocktail and beverage menu at Crab Hut is as noteworthy as the food selection. Cocktails include drinks inspired by New Orleans like the classic Hurricane, along with exotic herbal options like the River Gambler made with gin, lime, Thai basil, and cardamom bitters. “Our drinks are very crafty, and we are lucky enough to work with one of the best bartenders in San Diego,” Kim declares. The Beverage Director at Crab Hut is none other than the talented David Tye – one of San Diego’s most respected bartenders. The restaurant’s top-selling cocktail is the Gold-Plated Ship that includes multiple rums, mangoes, Ceylon cinnamon, pineapple, and other flavors made entirely in-house. Crab Hut also features craft beers sourced from breweries in the San Diego area."

                        "Crab Hut has been a customer of Sysco’s for almost fifteen years. “We started working with Sysco when we first opened – about five months in,” Kim explains. “I saw that my neighbor [at the time] got Sysco deliveries. At first, I thought that we’re not going to need enough [food products] for them to deliver, [but] my neighbor was selling milk tea and boba [in a] small shop, so I said if they can get Sysco to deliver, maybe they can deliver to us too. I went online and put in my contact info and I got a call back from our very first rep, Bob. He actually helped introduce me to a lot of local beers in San Diego. Those were the beers that we brought on for Crab Hut.” Kim describes her current Sysco Sales Consultant, Xiumei Zhang, as a dear friend that she has come to trust and respect. “We have a lot in common. She goes above and beyond, and I’m sure not just for me but for all of her accounts.”",
                        "Never one to compromise on high standards, Kim is grateful that Sysco provides affordable food products without sacrificing quality. “I know how hard it is to maintain competitive prices and also make sure that quality is delivered at the same time,” she describes. “I understand that there is a lot of overhead, and so I appreciate Sysco for trying their best to be consistent with price and quality.”",
                        "This year the co-owners of Crab Hut are planning to open another restaurant with an exciting new concept. “We have a new project that we’ve been working on, but because of Covid, it was delayed,” says Kim. “It’s a new Vietnamese and French restaurant and bar that will hopefully open up in August. We’ve been working on it for two years now. It’s a totally new [restaurant] concept [offering] modern Vietnamese food. The restaurant … emphasizes local ingredients with bold Vietnamese flavor.",
                        "If you are ever in the San Diego area, be sure to stop by one of the Crab Hut locations for Cajun flavors and unforgettable cocktails."

                        "Ruru’s menu offers customers fresh ingredients and flavors inspired by Latin, Korean, American, and Greek fare. “We didn’t want to strictly be tied into a Mexican restaurant theme,” explains O’Brien. “Our inspiration from the get-go was to come up with some really great tacos from a bunch of different cultures. When we started putting together the menu, we started pulling [from] things that we’ve tasted throughout our travels.” In keeping with the restaurant’s cinema-inspired theme, all menu items reference popular movies like the queso blanco and chips known as I Am McLovin from the film Superbad, or the flash-fried calamari known as Lighten Up Francis from the movie Stripes.",
                        "The a la carte taco menu features exciting flavor combinations like the Long Duck Dong taco made with Korean-style sweet and spicy steak, pickled cabbage, sesame seeds, and cilantro. More traditional taco options include familiar favorites like It Was the Dukes, made with slow-cooked pork belly carnitas, slaw, and salsa verde. “We didn’t want to be like every other restaurant out there,” says Sean. “We wanted to put our own spin on [things] and make sure that we focus a lot on really fresh food every single day. The feedback that we’ve gotten has been phenomenal.”",
                        "Beyond adventurous tacos with whimsical names, Ruru’s serves hand-crafted cocktails using quality spirits and fresh ingredients. “You can really taste the difference in the drinks because we use fresh lime juice and fresh juices and in our margaritas”, O’Brien explains. The drink menu includes options like a skinny margarita named Magic Mike, and a vodka-based drink called Divorce Party made with rosemary, mint, lime, and other flavors."

As Sean explains, “I think that [Sysco] has put some programs in place that are really trying to look out for restaurants to make sure that they continue to operate and be a success. They’ve done a pretty good job changing some of their practices and policies [like] not having the minimums and running out special trucks when needed.

What if they formed a co-op with neighboring ranchers to supply the lean-meat market with sustainably raised beef? Quickly, Country Natural Beef was born in 1986 with 14 ranch families. Since then, the co-op has grown—it now includes 80 family-owned ranches, offering Sysco customers some of the finest beef under Sysco’s Newport Pride Natural/Country Natural Beef brands."

True value, its ranchers believe, is based not on price but on yield, appearance and, most importantly, flavor. That makes Country Natural Beef—with its commitment to sustainability and high standards—a great partner with Sysco. All of the company’s cattle are 100 percent vegetarian-fed and hormone- and antibiotic-free. The ranchers are committed to animal welfare, allowing cattle to graze in a healthy way and prioritizing natural living. “We let cows be cows” is a guiding principle.",
                        "The result: beef that is not only high quality, but also lean and natural. The meat features good marbling, from animals that are 24 months and younger. And Country Natural Beef remains rancher owned and controlled (even the co-op’s accounting and production folks are ranchers), so the co-op is nimble.“We can adjust to what the market needs,” says Stacy Davies, Marketing Director at Country Natural Beef. “If customers want something, we’ll increase supply to fill the need.” And because the ranchers own the co-op, more money returns to them and to the small, rural communities where they live."

Once in America, the Bakshi’s continued to express their love of food by opening several restaurants – Masala Cafe, Bistro & Bar, and Flavor Restaurant & Bar. Despite the challenges brought on by the pandemic, in September 2020, the couple decided to open a fourth restaurant – Gather Cafe Bistro and Bar. Little did they know the pandemic wouldn’t be the only historical event to affect their business and community that year.",

Within hours the flames destroyed 2,800 structures over a span of nine miles. In all, three cities were affected by the fast-moving flames. The Bakshis and thousands of other families were ordered to evacuate, unsure of what they would find once they returned. “We bought this property just a month before the fire,” says Sumesh. “Three-thousand buildings got hit, and Talent was one of the worst [to be] hit. Against all odds, Gather was remarkably untouched by the flames. The fires had come close to the restaurant, but through firefighters’ heroic efforts and the changing course of the wind, the building was unharmed."

                        "Sysco Sales Consultant Marne Rickards has been with Gather every step of the way. Sumesh explains, “she has been [informing] us on the local palate [and what foods] will do well. We got to learn a lot of new dishes from [Sysco]. As Marne describes, “Together with our chefs, we were able to help them strategize their new menu and scale it back, so they were able to implement it at their opening. Over time we have helped them add new menu items, including many of the Cutting Edge Solutions offerings.”",
                        "To add convenience and safety to customers during the pandemic, the Bakshis relied on Sysco for supplies like single-use containers and contactless menu solutions like QR codes. As Dimple describes, “Anything that we need, we just contact [Sysco], and they are very available, very approachable, and very helpful throughout the whole process.”",
                        "Looking forward, the Bakshis plan to expand their lunch and dinner menu and extend business hours to better accommodate customers. Despite the challenges surrounding their opening, the owners of Gather remain incurable optimists. “Amongst all this chaos in terms of Covid and the fire, we are upbeat. We’ve been able to retain most of our staff, and we are not in the red. We are very confident that once this is over, and all of us are vaccinated…we’ll all be doing very well again.”",
                        "Gather has truly lived up to its name as a place for the community to gather, grow, and support one another. As the people of Talent, OR continue on the road to recovery, the Bakshis are committed to offering their support at every stage along the way. Sumesh says it best, “The human spirit is strong. Difficulties and challenges are always bound to be there, so you have to be flexible. Even when a horse goes to make a big jump, he goes back a few steps, so [setbacks don’t] mean you’re losing.",
                        "For Sumesh and Dimple Bakshi, life is good. If anyone in Talent, OR ever needs to feel inspired and hopeful, they know where to gather."

Joe Smith is the face of the restaurant; he is always on the floor. Joe’s sister, Kate Edwards, has worked here for 30 years. Our general manager, Derek Taulbee, has been here for 23 years. I [Joe Kendall] ran the kitchen for 15 years and am now happy behind the scenes. We have the most loyal staff, including five or six people who have been with us for 30 years.",

Now the crowd has grown way beyond the neighborhood, yet you definitely still feel like you are in an independent business when you eat here. You still feel like a local.",

Another popular dish is Pete’s Special, a burrito stuffed with Cajun chicken, Jack cheese and salsa. Our menu is classic American. We have burgers, fish, ribs, chops. And we offer different specials every night. We also have three separate bars offering 37 craft beers, wines, cocktails and some bourbons.",

(Millennials like taking pictures of their food and sharing on social media.) They’ve been awesome. Mike Haunert, the president of Sysco Cincinnati, has been here at least once every two weeks to see how we’re doing. Our Sysco representative, Joe Lima, is on call practically 24/7. They are truly a full-service company, and we appreciate it.",

                        "Chef Javier U. Lopez was born in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, but his culinary career first began to blossom after moving to Houston, Texas as a teenager. “I worked [at Bennigan’s] all throughout high school, starting as a prep cook and then making my way up to lead line cook,” he recalls. “This is where I learned organization, how to clean as you go, and the almighty sense of urgency that is only found in the service industry.”",
                        "Before long, Lopez found himself working at the upscale restaurant Brennan’s, where he was inspired to pursue formal culinary training at The Art Institute of Houston. His decision to satisfy his culinary ambition was matched only by his extraordinary work ethic – a requirement to endure his grueling schedule while attending culinary training.",
                        "“Going to school and working 70+ hours in the kitchen was a testament to just how passionate I was about food”, he says. “If I could offer any advice [to aspiring chefs], it would be to stay the course because hard work pays off. Educate yourself in any and all aspects culinary, and most importantly, learn the business behind being a chef”, says Lopez.",
                        "After graduation, Lopez once again relocated to pursue opportunities and career growth. He explains, ” I wanted to expand my culinary horizons, so I packed my knives and moved east to New Orleans, Louisiana. While in NOLA, I worked at Commander’s Palace, where I [had] the opportunity to work with individuals from all over the world. Everywhere I turned, there were new experiences to be had or more knowledge to be attained.”",
                        "Four years later, Chef Lopez found himself back in Houston to help open the upscale seafood restaurant, Pesce. “I rode that wave for eight years, all the while increasing my knowledge of all thing’s seafood”, he recalls. Shortly afterward, Lopez made his way back to Brennan’s, this time assuming the role of Executive Sous Chef. “Working for a tenured restaurant that revamps itself every other week was challenging but rewarding. This is where I refined my skills as a visionary chef and learned to stay on the cutting edge.”",
                        "After five years at Brennan’s, Chef Lopez used the tenacity and culinary expertise he had acquired throughout the years to embark on a new career with Sysco. “I have been [with Sysco] for almost five years. Similar to the restaurant industry, I have learned from an array of different positions, currently taking the spot of Specialist – Protein, and Culinary. This is the perfect lifestyle fit for someone like me. I not only get to offer my knowledge to my team and customers, but I also get to explore the limitless amount of cuisine and culture that the world has to offer.”",
                        "Chef Lopez has adventurously explored various food genres and cooking styles throughout his career, but his original introduction to cooking began with his grandmothers. “Watching my abuelas cook is where I learned the basics that would lay the foundation for my culinary career,” he recalls",
                        "That foundation and other culinary explorations have inspired Lopez to develop his own “freestyle” method of creating cuisines. “I like to put a creative twist on the traditional. I also enjoy the fusion of two or more genres of food. I like to call it ‘fusion not confusion,'” says Lopez. “My uniqueness comes from my background, culture, and my desire to never stop learning. These aspects of life are the framework that has made me the chef I am today.”",
                        "Chef Lopez is a valuable asset to our Sysco customers, both in and out of the kitchen. His foodservice industry expertise optimizes the performance and well-being of our customers while minimizing risk.  “All aspects of [the] business are important to the bigger picture… [especially] customer service, sales, and marketing.”",
                        "Chef Lopez has much to be proud of, but most of all, he enjoys the opportunity to share his love of food with his love of people. “I’m proud to be part of inspiring the next generation of chefs, building teams, watching ideas come to fruition, and creating lifelong memories for those that I have worked with as well as my guests over the years. To be honest, there are so many things that I’m proud of – the list goes on and on, needless [to say]  I love what I do”, he proclaims. “Inspiration is everywhere.”"

                        "For Chef Benjamin Udave, what began as an exit strategy became his grand entrance into the culinary world. Chef Benjamin is the Executive Chef for the Los Angeles Region. He has over 20 years of experience creating fine cuisine, mentoring kitchen professionals, and managing top-rated institution kitchens. His career in the culinary industry might seem like a lifelong dream come true, but in actuality, becoming a chef was Plan B.",
                        "Chef Benjamin aspired to pursue a career in law enforcement long before he ever stepped foot into the kitchen. “My original childhood dream was to become a police officer,” he recalls. “I realized that a degree in criminal justice was only going to limit me…so I decided to take another path as a backup plan.” That backup plan was to become a chef. “I loved food… so I figured that I would give myself 10 years to learn and develop my skills, and hopefully I would have enough industry credit that I could leave [cooking] to pursue my dream.”",
                        "Although becoming a chef wasn’t his long term goal, Benjamin approached his culinary career with admirable dedication and ambition. His hard work skills led to opportunities to work with catering companies, stadiums, and prestigious restaurants. He was also the executive chef at one of the most renowned clubs in the country – Jonathan Beach Club in Santa Monica.",
                        "Chef Benjamin reveled in his career’s success, not only for himself but also for his father, who always encouraged him to pursue his passions. “I always wanted to make my family proud, and seeing my parent’s joy as I kept growing in my professions was such a fuel for me,” he recalls.",
                        "Despite his success as a chef, the dream of becoming a police officer was still alive and well, until a series of events compelled Chef Benjamin to change course. “Unfortunately, during my transition from a chef to a police officer, my father passed away,” he explains. “I lost my entire drive and will to want to do anything as if the reason that I pushed myself to work harder was no longer there.” A hiring freeze at the police department dealt the chef another unexpected blow. His dream in law enforcement had come to an end, and now Benjamin was at a crossroads.",
                        "After a few months of self-growth and reflection, he reclaimed his spark and once again turned his sights to culinary pursuits. During that time, Chef Benjamin opened what is now a wildly popular rooftop restaurant and lounge in Downtown Los Angeles. “For me having the opportunity to build a restaurant from the ground up was not only overwhelming…it was also a privilege that many don’t get in their careers,” he says. “I poured my heart and soul into this project as if it were my own.”",
                        "Today, Chef Benjamin has come full circle as the Executive Chef in the Los Angeles area. “During my time in the restaurant industry, I was always a Sysco customer, so when the opportunity to come and lead the culinary team [came], I didn’t hesitate,” he says. In his 20 year career, Benjamin has been a Culinary Trend Consultant, mentored kitchen staff, and has acquired inventory management and cost control experience. His philosophy in the kitchen is, “there are multiple ways to run a business but only a few to run them successfully.” Benjamin believes strongly in keeping an open mind to meet consumer trends. “There is no place for an ego in this industry,” he proclaims. “We can always learn from someone else.”",
                        "In addition to his extraordinary leadership, Chef Benjamin also brings his “modern ethnic” culinary style to Sysco. “I am fortunate to live in a city where the food culture is pure, so you can taste foods that have not been adjusted or altered to the American palate,” he explains. “Once I understand a cuisine, I like to adapt it to the California scene and use local ingredients as well as other culture[s] to accomplish a more modern approach to dishes. Examples would be a Bahn mi Sopes – Gojuchang al pastor tacos – Birria Ramen.”",
                        "The chef takes a holistic approach to cooking that elevates the excitement of his cuisines. “One thing I pride myself on is making sure all your senses are touched when you eat my food. I want components to pop individually when you eat them, but together they produce a harmony in your mouth. Even if something I compose seems like it won’t work, I want you to know that I have done my [due] diligence to make sure it will.”",
                        "Throughout his career, Chef Benjamin’s only culinary rival is his most significant influencer – his mother. “Her flavors and technique were so consistent and to this day can make the simplest of dishes something to rave about. I have yet to be able to beat her in the kitchen. My food will never be as good as hers! Ever!”"

As a child, he had cooked at his mother’s and grandmother’s knees, and as a teen he had worked his way up from dishwasher to line cook at the local Ponderosa Steakhouse. After graduating high school, Means was living at home when his mom gently suggested he find his purpose. Later, a TV commercial came on announcing: “The Pennsylvania Culinary Academy is coming to your town!” He immediately thought, “I love to cook; that’s what I want to do.”"

He has since run several large-scale restaurants—sometimes more than one at a time—and joined Sysco Atlanta a little over three and a half years ago. What he loves most about his work as a Culinary Consultant is applying his experience by helping customers with every aspect of their business. The former student has now become the teacher. “You get to work with customers on everything from menu analysis to product selection to kitchen setup, down to where they’re going to put the fryer or flattop,” Means says. “You might have a new customer who wants to refresh their menu. We help them look at possibilities like adding new items and revamping classics, or we might recommend more cost-effective solutions to existing dishes.”"

                        "Conducting a Business Review is a team effort, according to Means. Once he has consulted with customers beforehand and determined their needs, he will reach out to specialists such as the produce or beef buyer to show a product. “I might say to the customer, ‘Instead of using a 5×6 tomato in your kitchen, let me show you our sliced tomatoes, which save time and labor.’” The changes that come out of a business review can be simple and seem minor. You might make adjustments to a customer’s menu items to help them save a few dollars. But in the larger scheme of things, Means says, the yearly savings can amount to many thousands of dollars, making a real difference in the bottom line, and giving them more capital to invest back into the operation. “Delivering value that will have a positive effect on the customer’s business,” says Means, “is one of the most rewarding  parts of the job.”"

When we got the space, we wanted to honor that spirit, so we invented a new style we call “Ark-Mex.” In addition to tacos and tamales, we serve things like fried chicken and fried catfish tacos with green-tomato pickle and remoulade sauce—it’s like Delta South meets Tex-Mex.",

I might call Lance Toler, Yellow Rocket’s Sales Consultant, five or six times a day just to brainstorm about new ingredients. We do blind tastings all the time. Almost all of our meats are antibiotic-free and all-natural, and we care about the ethical treatment of animals.

Unwilling to accept such a reality, Ortega made the fateful decision to hide in a freight train and cross into the U.S with little more than a hope for a better life.",
                        "In 1984, at the age of 17, Ortega found himself an undocumented immigrant living in Houston, Texas. In the beginning, it seemed that the odds were no more in his favor in the U.S than they had been in Mexico. At the time, Ortega spoke no English and had no job. He found himself homeless after his cousin with whom he’d been living relocated. Nevertheless, he was unwilling to wake from his American Dream and maintained a positive outlook.",
                        "Soon his hard work and positivity would pay off when in 1986, Ortega became a legalized immigrant through President Ronald Reagan’s amnesty program. That year he would also take the job that would change his life. After being hired as a dishwasher at Backstreet Cafe, Ortega enthusiastically worked his way up to busboy and then grill cook. Backstreet Cafe Owner, Tracy Vaught, saw tremendous potential in Ortega and encouraged him to attend culinary school to refine his natural abilities.",
                        "By 1992, Ortega graduated from the Houston Community College Culinary Arts Program. Three years later he assumed the role of Executive Chef at Backstreet Cafe. Chef Hugo experienced another exciting life-changing event – he and his former employer Tracy Vaught were married. The couple has now been married 26 years and has amassed an impressive empire of critically acclaimed Houston restaurants. They also have a daughter, Sophia Elizabeth."

On one occasion, she bought these pod seeds. They were about half an inch in diameter, and I remember her toasting these pod seeds in a clay comal, and she was quite devoted to making sure that every seed gets very toasted. I remember thinking, ‘what is this?’",
                        "“She told me, ‘it’s chocolate,’ but you know, I had never seen chocolate like that in a seed. At some point, she [asks me], ‘would you like to try it.’ I said, ‘yes, sure.’ So she took a little sample on her finger and put it on my tongue, and I remember telling her ‘grandma, I don’t like chocolate.’ She just laughed, and it was the first time I saw her laugh because she was a very serious conservative person. That is something that I will never forget.”",

In 2000, Chef Hugo took a trip to Oaxaca to visit his family and rediscover the ingredients in his homeland. He recalls how the goal of the trip was to “get acquainted with the wonderful countryside, the ingredients…and soak in everything I could during that trip.” Hugo’s menu features traditional dishes from various Mexico regions and includes cheeses, moles, and tortillas.",

The chef and his wife, Tracy, are investors in Origen restaurant located in Oaxaca, Mexico. The restaurant offers a contemporary interpretation of traditional Oaxacan ingredients and recipes.",

That’s where I met the first salesperson because, at the time, I was the person placing orders. It’s been a great relationship. We have grown together, and I am proud to say that we have been friends for a long time.”",

                        "When it comes to ground beef, safety and quality are the primary focus for both Cargill and Sysco. All Cargill and Sysco trucks that transport fresh meat are equipped with time temperature recorders that certify the temperature “never goes above 40 degrees, and the cold chain is maintained from when the beef leaves Cargill’s dock until it reaches your back door,” says Yale Lary, Quality Assurance Department PQM (Product Quality Management) Manager at Sysco. “Cargill is helping us to be a leader in the industry for food safety,” says Lary.",
                        "“Cargill micro-tests all of our ground beef and has state-of-the-art traceability systems so if they have to pull back a product, they know exactly where everything is before it even reaches the customer,” says Lary. Beyond their top-level safety and cold-chain controls, however, says Lary, “They are early adopters of technology, such as an online quality verification system, and they are constantly innovating and developing new products and ingredients that bring quality and value to the customer. They even helped Sysco develop our own proprietary beef blends, including our pre-seasoned beef patties.”",
                        "When you place a sizzling burger on a bun or serve your signature sliders to a diner, you need to feel confident in the meat’s safety and quality, as well as its great, consistent taste. Cargill and Sysco have combined forces to make Fire River Farms the best on the market."

                        "Chef Raymond Yakelis was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. He grew up watching his mother and grandparents skillfully prepare meals with an abundance of love and enthusiasm poured into every dish. At the age of six, Chef Raymond recalls helping his grandparents prepare gumbo – the official state cuisine of Louisiana. “Food to me is all about making people happy,” he explains. “That’s the joy in sharing the food. When you cook, you don’t even want to eat what you cook – you’re much more focused on embracing the people’s reaction to your food.”"

                        "Though his passion for cooking continued throughout his life, Raymond never made plans to become a chef. After discovering that college wasn’t for him, his mother insisted that he attend culinary school and turn his love of cooking into a lifelong career. In 2008, Raymond enrolled in culinary school at Delgado Community College, where he gained experience in some of New Orleans’s most renowned restaurants. As Chef Raymond recalls, “During my externship, I worked at New Orleans Country Club, which was a pretty well-known country club, and then I worked at Ralph’s On The Park, which is one of Brennan’s restaurants.” The Ralph Brennan Restaurant Group has been a prominent part of the Louisiana food scene for over three decades.",
                        "After working at Ralph’s On The Park for four years, Chef Raymond moved on to join Sysco as a Sales Consultant in 2014. In his new role, Chef Raymond supported customers by identifying the challenges and opportunities in their business and making recommendations on the Sysco solutions that would bring them success. Chef Raymond excelled in his position, but just as his mother insisted that he pursue culinary school instead of college, another influential figure in his life would redirect his path once again. Chef Raymond explains, “Jason Jones who…[was] our Director of Business Resources always had his eye on me and has always helped me succeed. [He’s] someone that I can reach out to for advice. He’s the one that really took the opportunity to push for me to get the chef’s position that I have now. Jason was adamant that I was the guy that he wanted. I’m very thankful for that and everything that he’s done for me.”",
                        "In 2016, Chef Raymond became the Culinary Specialist for Sysco New Orleans. “[Back then] Sysco New Orleans never actually had a chef,” he explains. “Our president at the time told us that we needed to hire a chef like every other operating company [in Sysco]. Having to basically build the program in New Orleans from scratch was a bit of [challenge]. I certainly had some help from my colleagues around the corporation but the biggest adversity was gaining the trust of our sales force who never had a chef to lean on before. They didn’t even necessarily understand what a culinary consultation was supposed to be. It was certainly a struggle trying to take an abandoned kitchen and turn it into a functioning kitchen, [while building] trust. Now my kitchen has a great rapport with the sales reps. They trust me, and that’s a really fantastic thing.”"

                        "Chef Raymond is as devoted to his team as he is to the success of Sysco customers. “I’m getting to the point where I see customers on an annual or biannual basis. It’s become [about] more than just [someone] coming in for their business review… it’s to the point where I feel like I’m invested in their business now. It makes [my job] easier, or even sometimes more difficult in a fun way, like – ‘I know I’ve shown you this, but let me dig a little deeper and see what I haven’t shown you.’ It’s really fun to feel like you’re embracing those restaurants.”",
                        "Chef Raymond’s commitment to the success of the customer was on full display when Sysco customer Higgins Hotel New Orleans faced an unexpected crisis in the kitchen. As Raymond describes, “It was 9:45 pm on a Friday, and the [wife of the] general manager at Higgins Hotel …texted me. They were at full capacity for the first time since Covid [began]. His coffee shop, where all of the food runs off what’s called a Merrychef Oven, had completely broken. If he couldn’t get it back up and running, it was going to cost him $2,000 a day in revenue.” It was then that Chef Raymond was asked if the hotel could borrow the Merrychef Oven housed at the Sysco New Orleans Operating Company. Chef Raymond didn’t have to think twice about his answer.",
                        "“I just felt like we had to do it”, he says. “This is a good customer, and I feel terrible for hotels. I feel like as bad as restaurants and bars had it, hotels had it just as bad during Covid, and I want them to have every opportunity to make that money back.” After discussing the decision with his boss, Chef Raymond woke up early the following day, and with his young daughter in tow, met with the manager to deliver the Merrychef Oven. “We came into the Operating Company at about 7:30 am,” he recalls. “I met the customer, got the piece of equipment loaded into his car, and he was able to jet over to the restaurant and have it set up at about 8:30 am. If someone needs help, I’m going to do everything I can to help them, especially [in a situation] like that.”"

You’re going to start out doing the not-so-fun things, but always be happy to do those things. Show up on time. Show up early. I was notoriously that person who would show up an hour and a half early because I wanted to learn. If I was in this position and I wanted to get that position, I did my [job] well, but I always kept my eye on the next position so that one day if that person dropped the ball, I would be able to help out. I try my best to care for others.”",

It’s great to see the numbers we produce. It’s sort of like walking into these restaurants and having the restaurateurs look at you like you’re Superman. It’s kind of fun.” Anyone who knows Chef Raymond knows that he works hard, gets the job done, and has fun doing what he loves. Let the good times roll!"

                        "It’s an upscale, polished-casual restaurant specializing in contemporary American cuisine. Our passion is delighting every guest with customization.",
                        "<strong>How did the restaurant get started?</strong>",
                        "Three former steakhouse executives wanted a high-quality scratch kitchen for their new endeavor, and they hired me as the founding chef. We opened the first location in Hingham, Massachusetts, in 2005. We didn’t want to be tied to any one food category like steak or fish—we wanted to have something for everyone.",
                        "<strong>How did you decide to tailor parts of your menu around\nallergies and wellness?</strong>",
                        "In the beginning, it was about customization: giving the guests exactly what they wanted. We would split food in the kitchen for no charge. Our  CEO, Kevin Harron, has celiac disease. I watched how he navigated our menu and it made me want to try out more gluten-free items. First, we came out with a small gluten-free menu. We began sourcing gluten-free pasta, dinner rolls, burger buns. Our customers truly appreciate it.",
                        "<strong>What does the Lifestyle section of the menu represent?</strong>",
                        "It started as a small section for paleo-friendly dishes, and we watched the interest grow. We always had a vegetarian menu, so we combined those options into one place. We can also accommodate eating plans like keto and Whole30. That section will continue to evolve. In my opinion, this is how people are shifting their dining preferences.",
                        "<strong>What are some of your signature dishes?</strong>",
                        "General Tso’s Cauliflower as an appetizer, the Superfood Salad, and for entrées, the Crab Crusted Haddock and Mediterranean Chicken Risotto are very popular. People go off the hook for our burgers, and our Short Rib Grilled Cheese Sandwich is out of this world. In the Lifestyle section, customers love the Roasted Veggie Quinoa Bowl. Our children’s menus are also popular.",
                        "<strong>What food items do you typically source from Sysco?</strong>",
                        "We get our chicken, some beef (including all our burger meat) and our pork chops from Sysco. All of our olive oils, vinegars and spices are from Sysco, too. We also get our gluten-free products, such as flour, panko, burger buns and pasta from Sysco, and those items—as you can tell—are a very important part of our menu.",
                        "<strong>How has success been an integral partner in your success?</strong>",
                        "Having a consistent broadline company like Sysco that can deliver on the right timeline has worked out great for us. I also like the price stability. We have a great relationship with our account representative, Steve Husson. We’ve worked together for four or five years now, and if there is a problem, he is very responsive. Steve watches our account closely and makes sure it’s all working properly.",
                        "<strong>What are your plans for the future?</strong>",
                        "We plan to continue to open restaurants, with more coming in the Southern market. And we will continue to push forward with our allergy commitment, and with the Lifestyle section, making sure we are offering relevant, healthy, flavorful cuisine and beverages to our customers."

                        "Chef Moore’s journey to opening Soirée Steak & Oyster House began when she was a small child. She recalls fondly preparing meals with her grandmother for her father, who would come home for lunch after working on the Sante Fe Railroad. “We’d always do red beans and rice on Sunday while we were washing laundry and folding; that was a ritual in our house. We always gathered together and had a buffet of food [eating everything] from cow tongue to duck.”",
                        "In 2013, Moore began attending Kansas City’s LeCole Culinary School and later graduated at the top of her class. For the next few years, Moore made a name for herself in the Kansas City food scene, combining her love of southern comfort food with her expertise as a corporate chef. By 2017, she opened her first restaurant – Soirée New Orleans Bistro. Two years later, she opened the sister restaurant Soirée Steak & Oyster House.",
                        "Soirée is appropriately located in the 18th & Vine District, an area known for jazz music and a historic hub of African-American businesses. The spacious restaurant features a craft cocktail bar and a dedicated stage where jazz bands and vocalists serenade customers during dinner service. As Chef Moore explains, “Being down in the historic jazz district [I wanted to] highlight local talent. I want people to feel welcome like they are coming into my home, so to speak, to enjoy good food and music. Every one of my customers has been here countless times, so it’s kind of like walking into a family. Everyone knows each other down here.”"

We bring in the food that I grew up with and fuse it with other cultures. We don’t just do Southern [cuisine].”",

The shrimp and grits on our brunch menu are a [top] seller on the weekend.” Other crowd favorites include fried green tomatoes served with roasted red pepper crawfish sauce and fresh blue cheese crumbles. The house-made spicy cocktail sauce and pickled watermelon mignonette accompanying the half-shell oysters are yet another example of why customers can’t get enough of Soirée’s innovative flavors."

                        "Soiree Steaks & Oyster House has been a Sysco customer for over two years. In that time, Chef Moore has worked closely with Sysco Sales Consultant, Toni Ortiz, to ensure the long-term success of the business. “Toni is amazing,” Moore proclaims. “I was [originally] with another company [before Sysco], but she won my business. I think it’s her interpersonal skills and making sure that I succeed as an owner. I really feel like she is genuine and wants to make sure that we have the best products offered to us.”",
                        "Chef Moore has complete confidence that Sysco is up to the task of supplying her restaurant with only the freshest ingredients, delivered on time, and meeting the high expectations of her customers. “I think that the quality of the products that [Sysco] has is amazing, she says. “I’ve never been disappointed. My deliveries are on time, and they always go above and beyond. To me, [Sysco] is not just a company but more of a partner for my restaurant.”",
                        "Looking forward to the year ahead, Chef Moore is excited to participate in initiatives like Black Restaurant Week (BRW) – a program that celebrates African-American, African, and Caribbean cuisine by helping consumers discover black-owned restaurants across the country. Since 2016, BRW has helped increase the visibility of black-owned food trucks, catering services, and exciting restaurants like Soiree Steak & Oyster House. “Working with Black Restaurant Week has been amazing,” says Chef Moore. “To be included on a list of other black-owned restaurants across the states is very humbling. I am honored to help recognize and put black-owned restaurants and chefs on a platform.”",
                        "If you’re ever lucky enough to find yourself in the historic Jazz District of Kansas City, don’t miss an opportunity to experience live music with soulful cuisine at Soiree."

                        "For anyone who knows Anthony, the evolution from basic training to kitchen brigade isn’t a surprise. For over two decades, he has demonstrated a propensity for teamwork, striving for excellence, and bravely pursuing the path less traveled.",
                        "Anthony’s introduction to cooking began as a child. His mother lovingly prepared daily meals for the entire family, which included five children, a husband, and two grandparents. Her attention to detail and commitment to providing quality meals like chicken risotto, taught Anthony the value of attention and detail. Despite an appreciation for quality cuisine, Anthony’s parents never expected him to pursue a culinary career",
                        "Directly after high school, he began working at his father’s construction company. Anthony recalls, “it was glaringly apparent to me that this was not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.” Instead, he decided to enlist in the Navy. “I…did not know what I wanted to do for a career, so spending [the next] four years in the Navy would give me time and college money to figure it all out,” he says. “This did not go over well with my father, so I parted ways with the construction industry and looked for a job while waiting to leave for boot camp.",
                        "In 1987 Anthony took his first job in foodservice as a prep cook at Reel Seafood Company. The kitchen ran like a well-oiled machine, making a lasting impression on the future chef. “I was amazed how organized, and orderly everything was, and how focused the Chef and his brigade were,” he recalls.” After just a month of working at the restaurant, Anthony had the opportunity to man the Raw Bar and became even more engrossed with the foodservice industry. “I was instantly drawn to the energy, controlled chaos, and adrenaline rush that came with a full restaurant every night from 5 pm-10 pm.”",
                        "Anthony enjoyed working at the restaurant for another six months until the day he left for Navy boot camp<strong>.</strong> For the next four years, he fulfilled his service commitment to the Navy with the same enthusiasm he had brought to the restaurant. In training, Anthony learned about the Navy’s core values of honor, courage, and commitment. Training included classroom studies and grueling physical conditioning that only the strongest cadets endure.",
                        "After fulfilling his commitment to the Navy, Anthony returned to Albany, New York. Two years later, he found himself uncertain of the future and unenthusiastic about the present. “[I was] spinning my wheels making lateral moves in the restaurant industry and not very happy with where I was in my career.”  Little did he know, one question would change his whole life.",
                        "“One night I was prepping for a wedding with Chef Vera Johnson [who] recognized [that] I was just there for a job and lacked passion, Anthony says. “ [She] put a brochure on my cutting board for The Culinary Institute of America. Vera [then] said to me, ‘you can be a Dodge Omni or a Ferrari; it’s your choice. Now, I want you to go home, look through this brochure, and let me know which one you want to be tomorrow.’… I left for the night and read through the information [that] she gave me, [then] something clicked.",
                        "The following week Anthony was on campus touring The Culinary Institute of America. “I toured the campus in Hyde Park, and it was like walking into Yankee Stadium for the first time as a kid,” he says. For the next six months, Anthony continued working with Chef Vera as he immersed himself in the culinary program. “[I thanked] her numerous times for putting me on the right path to not having a job in the restaurant industry but preparing myself for a career in the culinary industry.",
                        "After Culinary School, Chef Anthony worked his way up to Executive Sous Chef at a restaurant in Saratoga, New York. Although he had plans to become the Executive Chef, an unexpected turn of events redirected his path once again. Anthony explains, “[the Executive Chef] was retiring and had groomed me to replace him after 30 years at the helm. During the interview process, it came down to myself and another outside candidate. They choose the other candidate…” Losing the opportunity to an outside chef was a devastating blow to Anthony. Now a newlywed and father to a young son, the prospect of repeating the old cycle of trading one lateral career move for another was no longer an option.",
                        "“After a heart to heart talk with my wife, I decided to put in my notice with no clear path for the future,” he says. “Two days after giving my notice, I received a call from a former colleague asking if I would be interested in opening a new catering / a la Carte / Golf Club for a local entrepreneur in Clifton Park. I accepted the position…” That decision changed his entire career trajectory and was the vertical move that Chef Anthony had dreamed of achieving. “As my wife said, you can be bitter or better. I choose better.”",
                        "Today, Chef Anthony leverages his culinary expertise and profitable business strategies to help Sysco customers meet consumer needs. “The [most difficult part] in this industry is [producing] great food and [making] money at the same time,” he says. “[A] chef needs a full understanding that it is not about what you like, it is about what you can sell, and sell profitably.”",
                        "Chef Anthony’s cooking style offers customers a vast array of cultural influences from regions all around the world. “I am a bit of a culinary chameleon”, he describes. “I am classically French trained [and] love cooking Mexican and Spanish Street food, [along with] Japanese, Thai, and traditional German Cuisine…My career has allowed me [to prepare] fine dining, barbeque, ethnic [cuisine] and everything in between.”",
                        "Chef Anthony is one of the thousands of veteran chefs who have served their country and now serve Americans through the universal language of food. Through a commitment to excellence and a spirit of service, these men and women are part of what makes our nation great."

That’s where Sysco became critical. Working closely with our Sysco representative for guidance, we started to use better meats and added some popular menu items, like a California turkey club. Now people say, “Their food is excellent, and don’t miss the ice cream.” Our Sysco business resource consultant also helped train our servers and gave me great advice about promoting special menu items. We found that most people want to hear the suggestions a server has to offer when they order.",

For example, we already offered our crab sandwich, but after meeting with them, we added a deluxe crab sandwich with avocado and cheddar cheese, and it’s one of our most popular sandwiches. After we started promoting those items, our sales went up 10 percent the next year. In addition, Sysco has been able to go to suppliers of our major items and lock in better pricing. That’s been crucial to our success."

                        "Each growing territory has its own distinct advantages, says Hartley. Washington is known for its excellent reds and whites. Idaho and Utah provide large Spanish-style onions, perfect for many food service uses. New Mexico and Mexico support the Northwest with a reliable 12-month growing season, allowing the company to supply Sysco with onions throughout the year, including in the summer. Onions 52 doesn’t take its growth for granted. “As growers, we feel it is very important to be keepers of the land and stewards of the land,” says Hartley. “We have been working on sustainability for years, and it’s a continuing process. In certain locations, we try to keep wind erosion down; in others, we work to keep water evaporation down.” One environmental positive about growing onions: The crop is good for the soil. You never want to sow onions in the same field season after season, Hartley says, but whatever follows them, whether it’s corn, potatoes or hay, generally thrives from the nutrients left behind."

Onions 52 has a transportation hub in Utah and the ability to ship from all over the country. “Because of that, we can help Sysco keep down the cost of goods and keep them as competitive as possible,” says Hartley. Selling to Sysco has also helped Onions 52 grow aggressively. “Once [Sysco] commits to us, we know we can plant more onions, because the buyer is going to be there. And that’s a great partnership.”"

It’s that kind of one-on-one connection that you can’t beat, especially if you are a big grocery chain. You also have to stand behind your product. When you carry a good product, people are going to come back because they know their steak or pork chop is going to be tender and flavorful for everyone sitting down at dinner. Another key is making sure your meat is cut to the specifications of the customer. A lot of butchers will cut for profit. We want to make a profit, obviously, but we cut for the enjoyment of the customer. They’re not going to have a plateful of fat and gristle, and that’s what makes us stand out as different from any supermarket and most butcher shops."

The restaurant sat under fifty people and served a modest menu of a few dozen Chinese and American dishes. By 1958, Madeline and Bill Wong bought out the first generation owners and changed the name to Kowloon Restaurant – named after an urban area in Hong Kong, China.",
                        "Around the 1970s, the new owners transformed the business into a premier multi-concept restaurant that seats an astounding 1,200 customers. Upon entering the business, diners are invited to experience the look and feel of multiple eateries under one roof – all part of the series of themed dining rooms throughout the space. Each room offers something unique – The Luau Room features red lanterns, while the Tiki Lagoon Room includes a mini lagoon, and other room themes like the Volcano Bay offer even more exciting visuals to delight guests.",
                        "Today the restaurant is under the ownership of the third generation in the Wong family that includes siblings: Andy, Bob, Linda, Lisa, Donald, and Stanly Wong. The unique multi-concept restaurant has drawn athletes, politicians, and music legends throughout the years, along with celebrities like Forest Whitaker, Anne Hathaway, and Jerry Seinfield. As Stanley Wong explains, “We have comedy, we have bands playing, music, DJ’s, and now we have a drive-in movie, so it’s a one-stop-shop where you can stay the whole evening and enjoy [yourself]. “We want to make [Kowloon] a destination versus just a place to have dinner.”"

When Nixon opened up to China [in the early 1970s], there was more Szechuan, Hunan, and spicier foods being brought in. [In recent years] the demand for certain items has changed due to the fact that the younger generation likes different things than the older generation. When we added Thai and sushi, we gained a different crowd that just didn’t want the Cantonese or Szechuan food, so we adapted to the times. Crab rangoon is preferred by twenty and thirty-year-olds, whereas my generation probably ate more chicken wings, spare ribs, and chicken fingers.”"

He’s been super! Anything that I ask for, he looks into it for me.” Neil has been invaluable when supporting the restaurant in keeping food costs down – despite the nationwide truck driver shortage that has created delays in food deliveries and price increases. “Pricing has gone through the roof,” says Stanley. “I’ve been fortunate enough to lock in some key food prices with Sysco, which keeps me going without raising prices on my menu – a huge thing during the pandemic.”",

We put down astroturf so that it doesn’t look like a parking lot, and we put out chairs and umbrellas.” We started that about a year and a half ago. My brother Bobby came up with the ideas because at the time, no one could [dine in], so we started expanding.”",
                        "Three generations in business, the Wong family remains as strong as ever and fully committed to the family restaurant and each other. “People ask me all the time how is it working with your family?” says Stanley. I am so fortunate that I get to see my brothers and sisters more often than regular families would. You can’t take that for granted. Family is the most important thing.”",

                        "Chef Rachanee Teipen grew up enjoying the bold rich flavors of her Thai Heritage. Memories of her grandmother preparing meals with generations-old techniques fascinate her to this day. “She cooked with care and so much love,” Rachanee recalls. You could taste it in her food. Little did Rachanee know, someday she would be fascinating the world with her food, even if it meant walking away from a lifelong dream.",
                        "Before Rachanee became a professional chef, she had aspirations of being a performer. “As a kid… my career focus was on singing and acting,” she recalls. “I grew up in Southern California in Los Angeles where I was signed with a talent agency, but in 1994 after a major earthquake, my parents decided that California wasn’t the right fit for our family.” Despite the move, Rachanee continued to study theatre and eventually enrolled in the Musical Theater Program at Western Michigan University.",
                        "While working her way through school at a local cafe, Rachanee unexpectedly found a new love – cooking. “I learned how to cook and bake, and ended up thriving in the kitchen,” she says. “I had found a new passion!” That new passion was so profound that Rachanee left the musical theatre program to reevaluate her career path. After soul searching, she packed up her life and booked a one-way ticket to Chicago to enroll at the Le Cordon Bleu Culinary Arts program.",
                        "After culinary school, Rachanee moved to Indianapolis for an internship with Thomas Caterers of Distinction. “I ended up thriving in the kitchen there as well,” she says. “[I] moved up to Cook One, then to Sous-Chef, and eventually took the Executive Chef position.” Rachanee remained at the catering company for eleven years before becoming the Executive Chef at the prestigious Conrad Hotel. Her role required meticulous attention to detail and great leadership to manage the hotel’s banquet operations and a team of nearly 20 staff members. Chef Rachanee excelled in her role, and was honored as one of only six chefs chosen to participate in the Hilton North America Chef Stories Series.",
                        "Ever the consummate artist, Rachanee is best known for her creative plating presentations. “I think my artistry and attention to detail makes me unique and sets me apart from others,” she describes. “I can envision a concept in my head and relay that in my dishes. I [am meticulous when] plating. Every ingredient has its place.” Rachanee has drawn inspiration from various culinary influences throughout her career, but the “feeling” that comes from the flavors and textures in her cuisines, remains at the core of her cooking. “I can be meticulous and detailed, but comfort foods are my heart and soul,” she explains. “If anything, the comfort food aspect of my heritage is what you see more of in my dishes.”",
                        "Chef Rachanee has played an active role in professional culinary organizations for the past eleven years. “I was active in the International Caterers Association (ICA), which is a worldwide association for caterers where I was fortunate [enough] to meet and work with chefs from all around the country,” she says. She was also part of Leading Caterers of America (LCA). Her work within these organizations has resulted in a cookbook collaboration with chefs across the country, invaluable connections with industry-leading chefs, and numerous awards.",
                        "Despite her many accomplishments, Chef Rachanee knows all too well the obstacles of being a female professional in a male-dominated industry. “Being a woman and a minority in this industry, or really any industry, is tough,” she says. “[You] always have to prove yourself and your worth no matter how successful you are, or what accolades you’ve accomplished. I’ve had people look down on me, and…chefs question my abilities before even giving me the chance to show them my skills.” Undeterred, Chef Rachanee has made her mark in every position she’s held in her culinary career, including her current role as a Sysco Culinary Consultant."

This industry is so fast-paced, and it’s exciting to show customers new trends, innovations, and ideas that we can provide for them.” Rachanee believes that customer success comes down to consistency, quality, and adaptability. “Being successful in this industry means being able to see the big picture, especially during this pandemic,” she says. “Our customers also need to be able to [adapt] to navigate through the current [climate].”",

                        "The brother and sister team, Mitchell and Mollie Murphree, opened Five Senses in the winter of 2004. “My sister and I started the restaurant. The name was her idea. She gets full credit on the name,” explains Mitchell. “Cooking is the only art that involves the use of all five senses, so it just stuck.” In 2007 the restaurant added catering services to its offerings, and by 2011 Mitchell became the sole proprietor of Five Senses Restaurant & Catering.",
                        "Although Mitchell is the Executive Chef at the restaurant, his introduction to the culinary world began in food science. “I had a degree at UT Knoxville in food science and technology,” he recalls. “That’s not cooking at all, that’s more research and development, microbiology, food laws, and labeling for big companies. I got a job my junior year in college at a pizza place called Tomato Head, founded by Mahasti Vafaie in Knoxville, Tennessee. [There] I kind of fell in love with the restaurant business and cooking. I had a great boss there, and she mentioned culinary school [to me]. I hadn’t really thought about that [but]… I ended up going after graduating from UT Knoxville to The Culinary Institute of America in CIA Hyde Park, New York. My first job out of culinary school was at Highlands Bar and Grill, owned by chef Frank Stitt and Pardis Stitt in Birmingham, Alabama. I was there for two years and then came up to Murfreesboro. That five-year stretch at Tomato Head, culinary school, and Highlands Bar and Grill pointed me in a direction that I wanted to own my own restaurant.”",
                        "Although Five Senses provides diners with a high-quality menu in a vibrant, industrial-chic space, Mitchell doesn’t embrace the fine dining restaurant title. “One of the things I hate being called is fine dining,” he proclaims. “We kind of coined it fun-dining. We really wanted to make [the restaurant] fun and interactive. We have always had an open food bar, and it’s a completely open kitchen. Those are the most desired seats in the house. [People want to] sit up at the food bar and mix and mingle with the chefs and ask what they’re doing."

                        "Five Senses brings the community of Murfreesboro a gourmet experience dedicated by the seasons. As Mitchell explains, “That gourmet, locally sourced, seasonal menu concept [is] … almost cliche now; but seventeen years ago the thought of buying all the food from the farmers market, and supporting local agriculture…was still a very new thing. We let the farmers who are around us … dictate what we put on the menu.",
                        "The food at Five Senses features an eclectic assortment of seasonal dishes from a variety of cultural influences. “I think it’s hard to put us in a category,” Mitchell explains. “We started out with Southern regional cuisine, whether it’s by making grits fancy or [making] pork osso buco instead of veal osso buco. We always have different ethnicities represented on the menu now, and even in the beginning, we did, but we really focused on our Southern heritage.”",
                        "The list of popular menu items is endless, thanks to fresh ingredients like sweet potatoes and heirloom tomatoes. As Mitchell explains, “our take on eggplant parmesan is a staple summer item of heirloom tomatoes, dressed with sherry vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, and fresh basil, stacked with crispy breadcrumb fried eggplant and topped with parmesan cheese fondue and fried basil.” Seafood items are in high demand at Five Senses and feature customer favorites like the blackened redfish with wild American shrimp and grits. “Our seafood is our go-to,” proclaims Mitchell. “We get fresh fish, fresh shellfish, and shrimp [that’s] always wild. People really come for the seafood”. Another popular menu favorite is the Pork Osso Buco, served with mashed potatoes, turnip, rutabaga, carrot, mushroom, and winter greens. As Mitchell explains, “A lot of our braised items are really good. We’ve done quite a bit of braised lamb shanks and braised venison shoulders.”",
                        "Beyond the menu, if you ask Mitchell what makes the restaurant unique, he has two words, “the staff.” “They fire me up some days … they are fantastic. We’ve still got two people in our catering dept that have been with us since the day we opened our doors. Our General Manager [Andrew] has been with us for 11 years. Several servers have been with us for 4 and 5 years. That’s the main thing – we’ve developed a culture where people feel just as comfortable whether Andrew’s there or Will [our Kitchen Manager], or any of our other staff who they’ve seen for years. That’s our [reason for] success. There is no question about it.”"

March 2nd – 3rd, Nashville and surrounding areas were devastated by deadly tornadoes with winds above 175 mph. Hundreds of homes and businesses were destroyed, including the Sysco Nashville food distribution center. In a time of great uncertainty, Sysco’s sister operating sites jumped in with creative solutions to ensure that all customer orders would be fulfilled without disruption.",
                        "As Mitchell recalls, “That time specifically with the tornado, was an unsure time for a lot of people, and then the coronavirus hit about two and a half weeks right after that. Everybody was in a tailspin of what to do, but Sysco was there. I never questioned if they would be available, and they never gave me any reason to doubt that they would still take care of us after that tornado hit. Once the coronavirus came on board, they were there to give us new ideas about what people were doing. We have a private event space next to Five Senses, and we transitioned that into a mini grocery store with the help of Sysco. Not only were they out of their warehouse, but they were still finding ways to give us new fresh ideas and be that person that could do a lot of the research and … help us through that time. They’ve been good to us.”",

If I need something quickly or need something slightly after cut off, they always make it happen. They’re always talking about new ideas. Scott Brown, who’s our Regional Sales Representative, he’s been phenomenal, especially with some of the bigger events like Bonnaroo.”"

It makes for a really fun vibe, a really fun atmosphere, and I think it also helps with kitchen morale [when staff can] see that they have people sitting right there.” Mitchell is also excited to get back to catering in the Nashville community. “Our in-house dining was not overly hurt during all this, but the catering side was decimated,” he says. “We’re very much looking forward to the catering and private event side of our business [returning] and our revenue stream coming back.”",
                        "In reflecting on the past year, Mitchell has a newfound appreciation for restaurants and all the people and passion within the foodservice industry. “I think this time has definitely opened some eyes to the restaurant business and what people go through on a nightly basis,” Mitchell explains. “I think with food comes a sincerity [and a] passion that people have to bring. When you’re going to a restaurant, if your experience is good, you’re dealing with people who really do care about what they’re doing. Everybody can go through the motions, but having a really nice experience at a restaurant is [when] … there are people behind the scenes that put a lot of passion and care into what they do to make sure you have a good experience.”",
                        "That passion translates into everything that Five Senses Restaurant, Bar & Catering provides in the community of Murfreesboro. From supporting local agriculture to serving imaginative menu items, Mitchell has cultivated a restaurant that delights the senses in every season."

For eighteen years, the award-winning restaurant has served aged prime beef, fresh seafood, and quality chops in an elegant setting, complete with the original brick and wooden trellises from the early 1900s. Beyond providing quality food and exceptional guest service, the restaurant owners are known for their profound passion for giving back to the community and supporting staff, even if it means challenging the Illinois Governor."

                        "K.C became the Co-Owner and Chef of FoxFire a year after his father founded the restaurant with two former business partners. Since 2003 FoxFire has welcomed generations of customers as members of their extended family. “I think that what makes our restaurant unique would be the family behind it,” K.C explains. “It’s not just me and my dad, we [treat] our guests [and staff] like part of our family. We’re kind of like the Cheers of the steak house industry. Being at FoxFire for over 18 years, we’ve gotten to watch families grow. We’ve gone from two-year-olds and three-year-olds getting their first steak to now they’re planning their wedding rehearsals or their graduation from college [with us]. It’s kind of cool to see us evolve with the families.”",
                        "The menu at FoxFire features steakhouse classics and innovative flavor pairings inspired by consumer-driven trends. As K.C explains, “When we first started back in 2003, we were your traditional grandfather’s steakhouse with shrimp Dejohn, classic steaks, and the little bread wafers underneath the steak to give it some pop. Now we include some new methods of cooking [to] evolve with the times.” K.C often refers to Sysco Foodie as an online resource for the latest food trends and seasonal recipes. “[Sysco Foodie magazine] is one of the sources we go to with our reps to keep us in the know with what’s hot. It seems like every quarter we get an update on what the season will bring.”",
                        "At FoxFire, popular menu items include The Curt – a Cajun-crusted filet mignon served with wasabi yogurt and teriyaki glaze. “We call it The Curt because it’s my dad’s partner’s name,” explains K.C “He always wanted to get his steak Cajun crusted and served with a little teriyaki, which we found a little weird, but it turned out to be this really amazing flavor combo.” Another popular menu option and favorite of K.C’s is the Pittsburgh Style Ribeye – a 14oz. Prime CAB ribeye charred, rare, and served with grilled asparagus. “The Pittsburgh is something that I always played with,” he explains. “I just love the history of it. The Pittsburgh steak, or “Pittsburgh rare” as it’s commonly known, began when steelworkers brought raw steaks to the steel mills and cooked them on a burning hot furnace to quickly char the outside of the steak while keeping the inside raw. “It gives [the steak] such a unique flavor and crust to it,” says K.C “The combo is really good, and when you get that fattiness of the ribeye melting on that hot, hot piece of steel, it just gives it a lot of flavor when you bite into it.”"

To meet the high expectations of FoxFire customers and even higher standards of the owners, Sue, the Buckhead Pride representative, works closely with K.C to fulfill orders. As K.C explains, “[Sue] calls the actual butchers from Sysco, [and] they send me pictures of what they’re cutting. It’s an extra level of care that [says] you’re not just getting good quality food; you’re getting a quality individual taking care of you. We’ve had other people try to take [Sysco’s] place, but we’ve always said we have to have Sysco because other people don’t have their quality. They might provide a sales rep, that’s great, but you get both [quality and support] from Sysco.”",
                        "During the onset of the pandemic, Sysco supported FoxFire in creating innovative solutions to bring customers a taste of their favorite restaurant from the comfort and safety of home. As K.C explains, “It seemed like Sysco was there right away with ideas for us to do carry out dinners… [like our] very popular steak kits to go. We sell our [raw] steaks that we offer at the restaurant …with all our seasonings and finishing butter. In May, June, and July, when we were pretty much closed because of Covid, those things sold like hotcakes. People are excited about taking a piece of FoxFire home, and we couldn’t do that without the quality of Sysco behind it.”",
                        "To keep restaurants in business in a time of uncertainty, Sysco deployed several programs and initiatives to give business owners like K.C peace of mind. As he explains, “Some of the things that kept us afloat is Sysco came in and seemed to want to work with us on the financial end. When [Covid] hit… before we could get our PPP or SBA loans, [Sysco] had a payment program set up so we wouldn’t be getting hit with bills all the time and could manage the restaurant and the debt without anxiety or fear of going bankrupt.”"

                        "In the fall of 2020, FoxFire gained notoriety after filing a lawsuit against the indoor dining ban imposed by the Governor, J.B. Pritzker. The lawsuit was an effort to protect restaurant owners in the county from experiencing massive revenue loss, furloughing employees, and potentially closing their businesses for good. In late October, the county judge granted FoxFire a temporary restraining order that prevented public health officials from enforcing the dining ban at the restaurant. K.C believes the lawsuit was a noble stand for Geneva’s small restaurant owners that wanted to safely and responsibly serve their community, and keeping staff members employed. “By doing so, we’ve created a really good support system of customers and new people coming in,” says K.C “Do what’s right, and good things will happen.”",
                        "In the wake of disruptions caused by the pandemic, K.C, and his staff went to work to support the community in their time of need. “We did a program where if people brought in gift cards, they would receive a discount on their meal, and then the gift card would be donated to the employees of local restaurants,” he explains. FoxFire also participated in fundraising efforts to support the Help for Heroes program that provided meals for front-line workers. In the weeks to follow, FoxFire staff served meals to healthcare workers in nearby hospitals – a move that gave furloughed staff an opportunity to get out of their homes, serve their community, and do what they love.",
                        "This year, K.C is looking forward to opening a second FoxFire location to act as an event venue. “We’re getting a lot of requests from people to do private events at FoxFire. Unfortunately, with being a restaurant, we can’t close down for private events, [but] with this new venture, we will have two rooms that will accommodate private events. We’re excited about it, and we’re excited to bring Sysco along with us, who have been helpful in providing information on [how to have a] proper opening.” The venue will feature a craft kitchen and bar that will provide all menu items currently served at their original location.",
                        "From serving quality steaks to raising over $20,000 for charities, FoxFire  has served the city of Geneva well for nearly two decades. “Now we’re going onto another generation,” K.C explains. “I’ve got my nephew that’s coming on and another cousin that is in their 20s that’s just starting out.” FoxFire will forever be a family restaurant where everyone that walks through the door becomes part of the FoxFire family."

                        "When Dustin Maquet founded Maquet’s Rail House in Pekin, Illinois, he thought he was opening a simple craft beer bar. What he got was a popular restaurant and bar that grew at a pace Dustin never imagined. The modest food menu that accompanied the extensive selection of craft beers and wines, soon expanded to include appetizers, burgers, salads, and more. Last year Maquet’s Rail House increased menu sales by adding yet another popular item to their menu with the help of Sysco Marketing Services.",
                        "Dustin opened Maquet’s Rail House in August 2014 while still working his day job as a product support sales rep at Caterpillar, Inc. The craft bar featured an extensive selection of drink options and a minimal food menu under the assumption that patrons would be more interested in the bar’s pours than its plates of food. To Dustin’s surprise, the limited food menu drove the restaurant’s popularity. To meet the demand, Dustin quit his job at Caterpillar and fully dedicated his time to the restaurant. As the menu expanded, so did the wait staff, many of which are still working at Maquet’s Rail House today. Within a few years, the restaurant was bursting at the seams with staff, customers, and an extended menu.",
                        "Today, Maquet’s Rail House menu includes bar food staples like chicken wings, and yet reached beyond the expected with savory bites like Garlic Knots and Fried Mushrooms. Customers look forward to hearty salads, wraps, sandwiches, and burgers made with local ground beef. The bar has an extensive selection of craft beer, both on draft and in bottles, along with wines, bourbons, and single malt scotches.",
                        "In 2019 the restaurant and bar expanded by purchasing a neighboring historic building built in the early 1900s. Dustin added authentic Italian pizzas to the menu. All ingredients used to make the pizzas are carefully selected. “I’m all about high quality,” says Dustin. “I don’t shortcut anything on cost.” Even the brick oven that bakes the pizzas was handmade in Naples, Italy, to ensure that diners get the authentic Italian experience. Pizzas on the menu include traditional favorites like the Margherita pizza, along with their signature pizza – The Rail House that includes pepperoni, peppadew peppers, with fresh parmesan and Mike’s Hot Honey finish.",
                        "Their Sysco Sales Consultant, recommended that the pizzas be included on the main menu to increase pizza sales.  Although Dustin wasn’t sure about the concept, he was willing to try something new, and the risk was well worth the reward. “Our pizza sales went up approximately 42% after putting pizzas on our regular menu,” he recalls. “Previously, we only used table tents for pizza. Putting them on a ‘real’ menu definitely helped drive additional sales to that part of our food business.” As the sales consultant would say, “menu engineering can help sales.”",
                        "Due to the pandemic, many of those pizzas and other menu items are part of carryout and curbside orders. “Our town was really supportive…with curbside service when all this first started,” says Dustin. The restaurant offers carryout alcohol options like growlers of craft beers, along with their popular house drink. Despite the challenges brought on by the pandemic, Dustin is grateful to have the support and dedication of his staff. [Maquet’s Rail House has] a great reputation, and that’s probably what I’m most proud of. It takes a lot of hard work and a lot of great employees to make that happen.”"

                        "“We’re right in the ‘middle of everywhere,’” says T.J. Olson of his spacious steakhouse, which includes a full bar and ballroom. A visit to Round the Bend, located in the middle of a vast cornfield in Ashland, Nebraska, overlooking the Platte River Valley, is much more than just a quick bite—it’s an experience.",
                        "“We’re 20 minutes from Lincoln and Omaha,” Olson says. “And once you get here, [pre-COVID-19] you’ve usually got an hour and a half wait plus an hour or so to eat dinner, hang out and talk. When you come to Round the Bend on the weekends, it’s a real evening out.”",
                        "For his cooking, Olson abides by the KISS method: “Keep it simple, stupid—that’s my motto. We’re based in a farming community, so the people are very blue-collar, very hard-working,” Olson says. “They want to come in, have a beer and a good steak, and talk about their day.”",
                        "The simplicity and quality of Olson’s food also attracts the more sophisticated clientele from Lincoln and Omaha. “We don’t cover our steaks in gravies or fancy cheeses. We hand-cut everything in-house; all our steaks are 100% Certified Angus Beef, minimum 30 days wet-aged—all sourced through Sysco. Nothing but a touch of seasoning when we grill them on the open-flame charbroiler. We also do a lot of homemade specials, and our hamburgers are made of ground-beef trimmings from our steaks.”",
                        "In mid-2012, T.J. and Tifini bought the restaurant from T.J.’s father Ron, who had owned it since 1995, and had their first baby.",
                        "“Izzy was born 13 weeks premature and spent two months in the NICU with my wife. I ran the restaurant alone for two months. Everything got turned on its head,” says Olson. “But one thing that was so helpful—Sysco came in and gave us guidance. I didn’t go to business school or college. They helped us with everything from reengineering the menu to making sure we’re operating at 40% cost of goods. They know when the meat market’s going to shift, so we do a deal where we order 70 cases of sirloin and 40 cases of rib-eye, put it in their locker and they slot it for Round the Bend. That’s an incredible service.",
                        "“Over the years we’ve had three different reps: Red Meyer, Jeremy Stoecker and now Jason Moore. Their hard work is just incredible. I would refer to all of them as friends.”",
                        "“It’s not business, it’s a relationship,” says Olson. “For them to reach out and say, ‘Hey, Round the Bend, we value you, we see you, you guys are doing a good thing. We want to be there for you. How do we make this work even better?’”",
                        "Sysco has also been a key partner for the restaurant during the pandemic, as T.J. and Tifini had to make several pivots to accommodate the sudden changes in dining regulations.",
                        "After the initial shutdown, “we actually moved our dining room into the ballroom, which has worked out great,” says Olson. “That room can hold 600 people, and my dining room only seats 180, so we’ve been able to operate at [our previous] full capacity through all of COVID-19.”",
                        "In addition, with the help of Sysco, Round the Bend began selling to-go bundles of premium raw steaks. “We just sold out of our ‘mega-meat bundles.’ We put a ton of meat in a bundle and prepackage it for 99 bucks. We just sold out of all 300 of them, and everybody’s picking them up this week,” Olson says. “Without Sysco’s buying power and their ability to purchase and house that much meat for us and not charge us for that until we get it in our doors, we would never have been able to make those work.”",
                        "T.J. has also become an unlikely convert to Facebook Live. “I’ve disliked Facebook for years. I never wanted it. But we realized quickly that it’s the only way we could communicate with our customers on a daily basis,” he says. “So we created this persona for me—based on the President’s daily press conferences—with me as a president and CEO character, and my executive chef became my ‘Secretary of Steak.’”",
                        "T.J. is converting part of the bar area into a boutique meat market called Bella Meat Market. “This will be all Certified Angus Beef, again, facilitated by our relationship with Sysco. It’s a way for people to comfortably and confidently buy the highest quality meats, either in person or online at BellaMeats.com.” They will also be delivering to locations in the Lincoln and Omaha areas."

For example, I use my experience to bring our customers insight on how to create or optimize a specific menu item that will attract new patrons and increase profit.” The satisfaction is even greater when Britten sees a restaurant menu and recognizes a dish he created for the owners."

Not surprisingly, in this part of the world, salmon is king. When not working, Durec is often involved with food in some way. He is on the board of several local organizations, including the British Columbia Restaurant & Food Services Association, and he and his colleagues do charitable work in the community. Last year, Sysco Kelowna donated nearly 100,000 pounds of fresh and frozen produce to local food banks. “If we can’t sell it, we can help feed local families,” says Durec. “That’s a win-win.”"

                        "Grandeur is a fast-casual burger bar based in Oakland, California, that has something for everyone. Here diners can enjoy burgers, hot ‘dawgs’, and wings with vegan, gluten-free, and halal meat options. Vahid Boyd, Grandeur’s owner, opened the restaurant to make dining more inclusive for all dietary preferences.",
                        "Boyd has been a vegan for nearly two decades and knows all too well the challenge of finding a restaurant that offers a variety of flavorful plant-based options. Dining out with friends or family can be an even greater challenge when searching for a restaurant that can accommodate the entire party’s dietary preferences. To solve this dilemma, Boyd set out to better serve vegans like himself and others with dietary restrictions and preferences that are often underserved. “I want to service as many people as possible,” says Boyd. “It’s about cultivating other ideas for a healthy lifestyle, and a way to bring people with different dietary restrictions together.”",
                        "Boyd’s 15 years of experience in the foodservice industry are well represented in his menu’s international flavors. The house-made sauces are not only vegan; they are inspired by flavors originating from Ethiopia, Asia, and Middle Eastern countries. Sauces like cumin aioli, molasses mustard, and ginger tahini give diners the option to mix and match flavors, creating a new experience with every meal. Diners can also select from various bread options such as a vegan pretzel bun or a gluten-free bun.",
                        "Sysco Sales Consultant Nathaniel Fort began working with Boyd long before the doors of Grandeur opened. Nathaniel explains, “I was introduced to them by the first chef that they started out with, and was able to build on the relationship largely through introducing them to the whole food show process. I drove [Boyd] all the way to [the Sysco food show in Santa Rosa] about an hour away from his business. [There] he was able to try a lot of products all in one day. He tried the Beyond Burger, the Impossible Burger, and a lot of other vegan products that we were just hitting the market. That helped out a lot with setting the foundation of what type of menu he was going to go with.”",
                        "Nathaniel also assisted in providing operational support before Grandeur’s opening. “I made contact with Ecolab so they could get their dish machine, and also [helped them] know what they needed to do to be compliant with the health department,” he says. As Boyd explains, “they’ve done a lot for me. They’ve been very hands-on.” That hands-on support has also been a great asset in helping Grandeur navigate the operational challenges brought on by the global pandemic.",
                        "Sysco is proud to support Boyd as he serves his community with quality, inclusive food options. Grandeur is an important fixture in the community as a small business, and a black-owned and operated restaurant. Diners can expect to see even more menu items in the future as Grandeur continues to evolve and do what they do best – bring people together with “food for all.”"

It doesn’t cost much more, it’s 100% yield and ready for the pan,” saving lots of labor and time. Because restaurants today are looking to cut labor costs, Lewis often asks customers about how they prepare specific products. For example, she might ask, “Do we have a prebreaded fried shrimp, such as <strong>Portico Classic Butterflied Breaded Shrimp</strong>, that’s close to what you’re making now and that wouldn’t require someone to sit in your kitchen and bread shrimp all day?”"

Lewis, who grew up in a military family, is also personally invested in supporting members of the armed forces.",
                        "Lewis also makes it a point to stay ahead of <a href=https://foodie.sysco.com/>restaurant trends</a> so she can better serve her customers. “When you enjoy your work, researching and reading about the food business isn’t a chore,” says Lewis. What does she think will be the next big thing? “I am seeing more interesting fusion concepts, like a German-Mexican food truck. After work, I’m excited to go try it out.”"

                        "Chef Sharon Steward is the Head Chef and Kitchen Manager at Manitoba Pioneer Camp, a Certified Sommelier, an educator, a cookbook author, wife, and mother. Throughout her life, caring for people with food has been her give back to humanity – whether it’s preparing a feast from scratch or training kitchen staff to cook for hundreds of campers. As someone that grew up with food allergies, she is conscious and compassionate in ensuring that all are welcome at her table, no matter their dietary needs.",
                        "As a child, Sharon grew up on her family’s grain farm in the Canadian province of Manitoba. Preparing wholesome fresh-made meals was a way of life in her household. Sharon enjoyed the process and preparation that went into cooking a feast for her family, and from an early age knew that cooking from the heart would someday be at the heart of her career.",
                        "At age 19, Sharon enrolled in The Culinary Arts program at Red River College. In her first year of study, she began working at St. Charles Country Club and remained there after graduation. “After school l apprenticed under one of the top chefs in Canada and learned an immense amount,” she recalls. “That [was also] my first experience with Sysco. [I got to see] the rep come and… have those brainstorming sessions to figure out what products [worked for us]. That commitment to customer service on Sysco’s behalf, and the deep intent to help us do our jobs… was evident.”",
                        "In 2004, Sharon moved to Calgary and began working at a fine dining restaurant, and soon after earned a sommelier diploma through the International Sommelier Guild. “My passion for food definitely continued, and I wanted to be able to pair wine with the food that I was cooking,” she says. Before long, Sharon’s expertise in foodservice and effective leadership allowed her to pivot to a consultant role. “I had been managing a restaurant from the front of the house and consulting for other hotels and restaurants, [and] their food and wine education.”",
                        "By 2009, Chef Sharon and her husband moved back to Winnipeg. The couple had been in the hospitality industry for years and wanted a change of pace that was better suited for their family. Three years later, Chef Sharon found her new culinary adventure as the head chef at Pioneer Camp Manitoba. She recalls, “We were considering having our own restaurant [but] then the opportunity for us to work at a camp came along. It was just the right fit for our family with small children at the time”.",
                        "Pioneer Camp Manitoba is an outdoor seasonal camp located on an island in Shoal Lake. Camper sessions are typically one or two weeks long, and host children ages 6 to 17. In 2017, Chef Sharon became a full-time staffer at the camp, and began living on the island four months out of the year. She describes the camp as “a magical place where campers can be themselves”. [Campers are] out in the wilderness in a beautiful space surrounded [by] creation…with so much to learn, absorb, and feel.”",
                        "The camp’s kitchen is entirely run by volunteers, making Chef Sharon’s expertise in front and back of the house operations an invaluable asset. Before Sharon’s arrival to the camp, kitchen volunteers received no formal training and relied on recipe cards with no cooking instructions. In the past six years, camp attendance has swelled from 140 campers to 600 campers – making efficient kitchen operations a vital yet complex undertaking.",
                        "Sharon explains – “There’s a lot of work and staff training that goes into producing our meals and figuring out how many people are needed to do a service. It helps that we have lots of volunteers that really want to be in a space like this to learn and be a part of a team. Moving into a space where they had never had a professional chef before, there was just so much need to tend to, and so much potential and possibility.” Kitchen volunteers include parents of campers, past and present, and even young people that have never held a knife, but are eager to learn.",
                        "Much like her childhood, Chef Sharon prepares meals for the campers from scratch to accommodate children with dietary restrictions. “I don’t work with a lot of processed food, even from our dressings and sauces. It’s all from scratch,” she declares. “Most everyone would say that their favorite meal is what we call our Sunday lunch meal – it’s my orange oregano marinated chicken.” Chef Sharon is also passionate about inclusive cooking practices that accommodate unique dietary needs. “No matter what the age of the guest, [I wanted to] make sure that they’re being cared for fully, [by]… having meals that are similar to others, [so no one feels] segregated because of their allergies or dietary restrictions.”",
                        "In addition to supporting kitchen volunteers with training and education tools, Chef Sharon was instrumental in bringing Sysco onboard as the camp’s food supplier. “I really appreciate the partnership that I can have with all of the people that I get to work with at Sysco,” she says. Her Sysco team includes Sales Consultant, Dayna Barclay, and Sysco Produce Specialist, Chef Laurie Wolfe.",

Students that complete the nine-month program earn The ProStart National Certificate of Achievement (COA). Schleiden’s goal for the course is to inspire students to pursue higher education through the confidence and skills they acquired within the program.",

Looking for a career change he decided to open a tavern. “I really enjoy the atmosphere of a tavern [and] wanted a nice family environment,” says Schleiden. I thought the best way to do that was to go to college and get a degree in the culinary arts so that I could [better] understand everything.” The long hours and demands of a restaurant redirected Schleiden’s career path into the field of education. “There’s a lot of educators in my family, and I probably should have started off as one but I took the long way. I’ve always been around this industry and really enjoy it.”",
                        "An unexpected opportunity brought the chef to CCCTC as the Culinary Arts and Food Management Program director. Not long after taking the position, Schleiden realized that his students would need more than knife skills during the course; they would need life skills and encouragement to overcome the challenges facing them outside the classroom. Some teenage students are the breadwinners in their family and must take on the adult’s responsibilities of the household. Other students learn differently and have given up on higher education after a lifetime of feeling disempowered in school. “I started turning my focus into giving them a way out,” says Schleiden. “[With] just two years of college, you can get somewhere.”",
                        "Schleiden designed the program’s curriculum around the culinary school that he attended at Johnson and Wales University. He explains, “my goal is to get the kids to just try two years of college, so I matched [the program], so when they got [to college], there will be some familiar ground [and] they won’t freak out. My curriculum is different every year based on what the students [want].” Program participants learn a variety of culinary skills, including baking and knife skills. “We prep about 300lbs of vegetables just to get the knife skills,” says Schleiden. Students also gain real-world experience in restaurant management through an intense restaurant simulation module.",
                        "Schleiden explains, “I have a little sous chef program that I do. We have a live kitchen open to the public, and each kid has to run it like they own it. They get a whole week of one-on-one really focused attention. I tell them ‘I’m not here to teach you how to flip a burger; I’m here to teach you how to be a manager.’ They are not allowed to touch any of the food. They can only delegate. [They’re] the supervisor, [they] own this place.”",
                        "This portion of the program teaches management skills while molding the students to become effective leaders in a fast-paced environment. “I put them under a lot of pressure in the first year to the point where they might hate it,” he explains. “As we’re going through that pressure, I explain to them this is a day to day occurrence. There are things you’re going to need to be able to handle [in a restaurant].”",
                        "Throughout the program, Schleiden hopes that each student gains clarity into which area of foodservice most aligns with their skills and interests. “You’re not gonna hurt my feelings if you don’t want to be here,” says. “That’s the whole point. Let’s find out what you like. Let’s find out what part of food service you’re actually [interested in pursuing]. Do you like the pressure of the kitchen or do you like the mental aspect of being a manager or owner? You got to figure out what part you like and what you can handle.”",
                        "The Culinary Arts and Food Management Program operates on a modest budget, requiring Schleiden to find cost-effective ways to meet students’ needs. In 2018 he reached out to Sysco District Sales Manager Rob Maynard to inquire about Sysco’s potential in becoming a program sponsor. Rob immediately jumped at the opportunity. Schleiden recalls, I don’t even think I took a breath and he was on the phone [making calls]. It took about a year, but he started a program that donated knife kits to all the students that came in every year, which is phenomenal because they can’t afford [it]. Sysco became this amazing entity for me. Anything I needed, they were doing it. Rob did a hell of a job, I gotta yell ya.”",
                        "The Culinary Arts and Food Management Program also uses the Sysco Shop ordering system to teach students about inventory, placing orders, and balancing a budget. “We started using Sysco solutions because they were willing to do so much for those kids” explains Schleiden. “I make them put my orders in for me. They go through the kitchen, [and] they put the orders together for the week when they’re in charge. [Then] we all sit down in the class and look through the Sysco database. They really do real-world stuff, everything from start to finish.”",
                        "This year’s students face significant challenges due to social distancing protocols in response to the pandemic. The nature of the curriculum requires hands-on training that does not translate well in a virtual learning environment. Schleiden explains, “these kids come to us in these career center schools because they learn differently, and some of them don’t even know that, but when they get [here] the lightbulb starts going on, and they think ‘oh my gosh [ I can do this]’. So you take their only way of learning away, and [it becomes clear] that they need the hands on learning to hold on to the information. We’ve had to change everything that we’re doing.”",
                        "The new scope of sequences in the program has been adapted to incorporate virtual learning, but as Schleiden explains, the need for in-person classes is vital for students in stressful home environments. “Their home life is so bad,” he says. “They don’t have anywhere else to go to get some solitude. Most of the teachers have decided that if [schools close] again we’re going to stay at the school. We’ll go to work every day, and we can social distance and follow the rules, but if a kid needs to come in, we can take care of them one at a time.”",
                        "Several students who have completed the Culinary Arts and Food Management Program have achieved degrees from two and four-year colleges; some even obtain nutrition and dietician degrees. For many students, the self-awareness and confidence gained within the program puts them on a path to educational, professional, and economic opportunities that would have otherwise been dismissed as unattainable goals. Each student has a story, and through the mentorship of Chef Daniel, and the support from companies like Sysco, each student has a chance at a happy ending. “I really enjoy people having the right information,” says Schleiden. “My primary mission is to see them succeed.”"

The restaurant began as a fine dining establishment that sold pizza off-menu from the Backdoor – thus the name Pop’s Backdoor. Two years later, the restaurant moved to its current location in South Durham. In 2016, Saroj Poudel took ownership of Pops Backdoor South after years of the restaurant being part of the Durham Restaurant Group.",
                        "After almost fifteen years of owning pizza franchises, Saroj is no stranger to pizza restaurants. ” I did almost nine years at Papa John’s and a couple of years at Dominos,” he says. Looking for more creative freedom and opportunities to design a consumer-driven menu, Saroj decided it was time to move away from the franchise model and become an independent restaurant owner. He explains, “I wanted something different. [With an independent restaurant] we have more liberty. You can experiment with the toppings. You can experiment with the sauces…we are not as restricted.” After taking ownership of Pop’s Backdoor South, Saroj renovated the front of the house and added new tables and booths."

Everything is made fresh here. The only sauce that we don’t make is barbecue – all the other sauces are made in-house.” Pizzas toppings at the restaurant go far beyond the typical pepperoni and cheese. The Granny Pizza comes with Granny Smith apples, french brie, white truffle oil, and ricotta cheese spread.",
                        "Another exciting option is Pop’s Famous Salty Pizza topped with egg, prosciutto, roasted garlic, and kalamata olives. When not ordering pizzas, customers come to the restaurant to enjoy homemade calzones filled with ricotta-mozzarella, served with pomodoro.",

The food shows offer Sysco customers the opportunity to meet vendors that offer specialty produce, custom-cut meats, gourmet imports, supplies, and resources to support the needs of business owners. Inspiration for Pop’s Backdoor South menu also comes from a business review held at the Sysco warehouse. “We try to make [things] a little different than what we find on the market,” says Saroj. [We want] our food to be unique",
                        "Saroj trusts Sysco Sales Consultant Richard Boston with Pop’s Backdoor South and four other restaurants that he owns in the Durham area. As Richard explains, “When Saroj first bought Pops Backdoor, he was on a quest to open additional locations throughout the area. He asked me if I would help him research other restaurants that were going up for sale or knew anyone interested in selling. Through our partnership, we have successfully opened Papa’s Pizza and Wings, HWY 54 Public House (formally Mattie B’s), Five Bros Pizza Creedmoor Rd. and Five Bros Midtown.”",
                        "Saroj’s love of serving pizza is matched only by consumers’ love for the popular food. “I enjoy trying to make a more quality pizza,” Saroj proclaims. “[Pizza is] the most popular food, not only for a single population, or single race – it’s [universal]. All people like it. The market for pizza will keep going and going, so I see a lot of opportunities.”"

We stuff the fish with lemon and thyme, roast it on a bed of salt, then serve [it] on a bed of arugula with a side of beans and boiled potatoes. For our Barbequed Head-On Shrimp, we use andouille sausage, garlic and rosemary, and serve them with a white-wine-and-butter sauce and grilled Tuscan bread.

Cooking food in small batches is better. You lose the touch of the spices and flavor when cooking in big batches. We don’t give diners a menu; we tell you what we’re cooking for the day, and you trust us."

Today, Southern Specialties has expanded its growing regions throughout North and South America, taking advantage of the wide-ranging micro-climates where its produce can thrive."

                        "The vision to design a restaurant that represented a more authentic version of Mexican cuisine led the owners of Mochilero Kitchen on a journey through Mexico to explore regional ingredients, cooking techniques, and recipes.",
                        "As Jorge describes, “the entire theme of the restaurant is based off of a trip that we took out to Mexico in early 2019 to dive into the culture of Mexico. We felt like there was a kind of a basic, bland version of what people understood as Mexican cuisine. We wanted to show more [from] other regions of Mexico that have a beautiful array of ingredients to explore, aside from tortillas and stuff like that people know as Mexican food.” Meliza goes on to explain – “Food is usually only found in traditional family homes where the recipes are as ancient as the culture itself. That was basically where the passion was coming from when Jorge went on this trip.”",
                        "While in Mexico, the restaurant owners toured twenty-two states that included Merida, Sonora, Mexico City, and Oaxaca. “Oaxaca was one of the more eye-opening areas of all of Mexico that really just showed how deep you can dive into the cuisine,” Jorge recalls.",
                        "Just as the restaurant’s name draws heavily on that pivotal journey (mochilero translates to “backpacker” in English), the restaurant’s interior design draws heavily on the aesthetics of life in Mexico. “Our interior designer, Beth, dissected Jorge’s thoughts and journey through his travels and delivered a trend-setting design [that makes] Mochilero Kitchen what it is today,” says Meliza. “Everything was intentionally created to take you through a very specific journey. That journey is to pair our food with the restaurant design so you can be transported to parts of Mexico.”",
                        "As Jorge recalls – “We paid attention to the architecture. When you look up at the spotlight in our main dining room, it looks like big wooden crates. That reminds me of how people move their produce around in the market places. There’s a lot of woodwork, stone, and a lot of raw materials [that is] handmade, just like our food, and we want to portray that in everything you see.”"

As Chef de Cuisine Jorge ensures that every item on the scratch-made menu is prepared using time-honored Mexican cooking techniques. “We don’t have any freezers, so everything is made fresh every single day, ” Meliza describes. “There’s someone at the restaurant at 6:30 a.m every morning making sure that everything is prepped fresh every single day. The food is amazing! What Jorge has done in the back of the house has been just incredible. From the textures of food, the sauces, and being able to utilize things like nuts, berries, sauces, chocolate, and moles of all different colors and textures – it’s just an amazing thing to experience.”",

As he recalls, “One of the things that we thought was important during our travels were the techniques [used in making] a lot of foods. We wanted to pay homage to the people that took care of us in Mexico. For example, we were in Oaxaca on one of our journeys, and we ended up taking an 8-hour class in just moles where we made about eight or nine different moles. When we make our moles in the restaurant, we really try to go through the same process to keep that authenticity.” Meliza adds, “When you combine that commitment to excellence from a quality standpoint, with the technique that Jorge mentioned, it just creates an incredible experience. He has really strived to put that trust into our restaurant that we don’t cut any corners.”",

La Tablita Combinacion is another crowd pleaser on the menu. “It just shows how abundant we can get with our presentations”, says Meliza. “It’s a very attractive looking dish and represents how communal we try to make the restaurant.” La Tablita Combinacion includes an 18-oz prime ribeye steak with giant adobo marinated Puerto Penasco shrimp that can easily serve a table of four.",

More than ever, dedicated Sysco partners, Sales Consultant Dan Peterson and District Manager Andrew Rice, worked to support Mochilero Kitchen in continuing their mission to provide authentic Mexican cuisine to the community.",

The main reason we were able to survive Covid is really just establishing those community connections, and Sysco was a really big part of that. We’ve been with [Sysco] from the beginning. Throughout the process, they’ve given us more and more information on how we can develop and increase productivity and make all of the back of the house [operations] effective. We’ve been supported the entire time by Sysco. I couldn’t be more thankful.”",

They were able to provide us with better strategies so that we could be more efficient when it came to curbside [service] and menu development within the marketing tools that they offer. The support from Sysco was palpable during those challenging times.”"

For awhile, we weren’t making money—business was good, but we were just paying our bills. Then, in March 2011, The Food Network featured us on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, and it was like flipping a switch. It was great exposure.

Other crowd-pleasers include the Jalapeno Honey Fried Chicken Sandwich and the Chili Lime Shrimp Tacos. Guided by the seasons, The Rural Seed’s menu rotates twice a year to bring customers the freshest ingredients possible while allowing the couple to test out cuisines like duck leg confit or lobster ravioli with shrimp. “We cook the way we like to eat,” says Adrienne. “We offer a little bit of everything,” John adds. “We try not to pigeonhole ourselves into one set style.”"

We’re a large restaurant group, a $100 million company. The local Sysco VP of Merchandising comes here once a quarter to sit with us and talk about new items and how we can source them. Last year we all went down to the poultry processing plant together. We were looking at changing chicken suppliers, and they took us with them because it was a major change.

Shortly after relocating to Cary, Michael and his wife opened Maximillians Grill and Wine Bar. Soon after, Will and Margie began working at the restaurant under Michael’s mentorship. In 2015, the original owners of Maximillians retired and passed the torch to the Maximillians legacy to Margie and Will.",

In the early days at Maximillians the duty of menu-maker was yet another task on their to-do list. As Margie explains, “we’d handwrite the menu and then take a dollar out of the drawer and walk across the street where there was a copy machine. It was a dime a copy and we would get a dollar’s worth of copies [each time]. Those would be the menus for the night.”"

This has a wide range of benefits, whether you want your fries to cling to a sauce or to each other as part of a loaded fry concept, poutine or nacho build. It is especially helpful if fries make up part of your takeout or delivery menu and need to maintain their crunch on the ride home."

The 75/25 meat will be juicier but more greasy, while 85/15 is a little healthier but has a tendency to dry out."

With Sysco’s fresh ground beef’s extended shelf life and our unbeatable quality assurance standards, frozen is no longer a food safety necessity. “But frozen still has its place,” says Irwin. Sysco’s frozen patties are individually quick-frozen to eliminate flavor degrada- tion and waffle-scored for better airflow and a faster cook time—a key factor for operators who do a high-volume business."

                        "Recently, more operators have begun to use more high-end and mixed meats in burgers. “Consumers will pay a small upcharge for grass-fed or Certified Angus Beef® burgers, and a larger one for something like wagyu beef,” says Bruce Barnes, Menu Consultant at Sysco. Sysco offers a range of primal-specific cuts and blends, from chuck and sirloin to specialty meats such as Sysco’s <strong>Fire River Farms Natural Imperial Grass-Fed Beef</strong>, <strong>Fire River Certified Angus Beef</strong>® and a three-way blend made up of chuck, brisket and sirloin."

                        "While many diners still enjoy a simple burger, others expect and want more—especially if they are paying a premium. Toppers like house-made kimchi, pickled vegetables, a fried egg, <strong>Sysco Pica y Salpica Chicharrón</strong> and <strong>Sysco Classic Onion Rings</strong> add spice, flavor and crunch to the mix. Artisanal cheeses such as local goat or Gouda pair well with different varieties of meats like ground lamb and pork. Consumers expect distinctive flavors and a distinctive look, too, in their burgers. The right bun can provide both. Sysco’s <strong>Baker’s Source Challah Bun</strong> has an undertone of sweetness and a golden-brown woven top. <strong>Baker’s Source Hawaiian Brioche Buns</strong> come in regular and slider size and include real pineapple chunks. Sysco’s popular <strong>Baker’s Source Potato Bun</strong> uses potato starch for a softer, lighter texture",
                        "According to Bruce Barnes, consumers appreciate a variety of burgers to choose from, but it’s best not to have too many items in any one category. Consider offering one nonmeat option and one nonbun option, for example, says Barnes. And include a build-your-own burger, too. That means everyone can get exactly what they want."

But the lack of a sea view doesn’t stop landlocked consumers from ordering plenty of seafood. In fact, the lean, healthy protein and omega-3–packed nutrition of fish and shellfish have never been more in demand, whether you’re on the docks of San Francisco or in downtown Des Moines. This is especially true of irresistible fried fish. Whether it’s breaded or lightly battered, everyone loves crispy, golden brown seafood, especially when it is sprinkled with salt and pepper and paired with a tangy sauce."

There will always be die-hard seafood fans—those who love to pick apart crabs’ legs piece by painstaking piece, or slurp down oysters on the half shell with no chaser. But even patrons who are normally squeamish about our sea-dwelling friends still appreciate the most accessible of seafoods: good old-fashioned fish and chips, whether wrapped in newspaper or served on bone china. Although it is usually made with cod, any firm white fish works well. You can also get creative and follow Sysco chef Greg Meeker’s lead by using salmon instead for fantastic results. Or take the dish upscale by using flavorful halibut when it’s in season, typically from mid-March through early November.",
                                "Fried fish of any kind, as well as fried shrimp, fried calamari or fried anything, pairs perfectly with Sysco dips and sauces. Use them as is or customize to suit your taste by adding fresh chopped herbs such as parsley and dill or spices like turmeric or paprika. Adding a spice paste like Korean Gochujang to mayonnaise is also an easy way to make your own sauce. Squeeze a lime or lemon, add salt and you’re there."

                                "Italy, which is surrounded by ocean on three sides, has its own version of fried fish—the fritto misto. Literally translated as “fried mix,” it is a delicious combination of seafood and vegetables coated in a light tempura-like batter and fried, then served with a simple sauce or just a lemon wedge. You can use octopus, calamari, small fish like fresh sardines and chunks of bigger white fish, and vegetables such as sliced eggplant, sliced zucchini or whatever you have on hand. The key is the light coating and right frying oil. The ingredients should shine through and not taste greasy or loaded down with a heavy breading or batter. Top the dish off with chile flakes and a little sea salt and serve.",

Proximity to a coast or lake is not a requirement, as Sysco distributes its high-quality, exquisitely fresh <strong>Portico Seafood</strong> all over the country. And a plate of ever-popular fish and chips or crisp and satisfying fritto misto is a great way to start."

Chef Peter Ecker of Sysco Winnipeg created a Thai-style tomato and coconut bisque with crispy cheese-stuffed wontons, topped with tempura shrimp for added Asian flair."

Diners who might not normally eat fish will order a clam chowder or seafood stew. Many customers would like to add more seafood to their diet, and soup makes it accessible.",
                                "But don’t hide that delicious fish, says Andrew Rivera-Myers, Culinary Consultant at Sysco Northern New England. He uses “big chunks of fish, so not only can you see the seafood, you can also taste it,” he says of his New England Seafood Chowder (below). “I only lightly thicken my chowder, and I like to go bold, using heavily smoked bacon, which imparts a really nice flavor to the broth.” He also uses a fair amount of freshly ground black pepper and other spices to enhance the natural taste of the fish and add a little heat in the colder months.",
                                "To go with the chowder, try classic lobster rolls made with Chef Rivera-Myers’ addition of basil mayonnaise. His version uses big chunks of lobster meat, <strong>Arrezzio Basil Pesto</strong> combined with mayo, and celery leaves inside a <strong>Baker’s Source Split-Top Hot Dog Bun</strong>."

Soups are a way to let colorful vegetables shine: think vibrant butternut squash and bright peas. But they are also an efficient way to use up “ugly” vegetables or vegetable scraps, saving money and avoiding food waste.",

When going for something more refined, you can use a chinois or an immersion blender to get a smooth, silky consistency. If you prefer to keep things light and healthy, lean on olive oil, with vegetables or chicken for your stock. If instead you’d prefer to serve something with full-bodied flavor, add butter or a ham hock at the base when sautéing the mirepoix. At the end, finish with <strong>Wholesome Farms Butter</strong> or <strong>Cream,</strong> or shave <strong>Arrezzio Parmesan Cheese</strong> on top for added richness. Top with a high-quality garnish such as a sprinkling of fresh herbs and homemade croutons, and you’ve got a delicious meal that always has a place at the table."

This time-consuming process makes cold brew more concentrated, giving it a less acidic taste and higher caffeine content. Cold brew has made its way from craft coffeehouses to national restaurant chains, where the drink is quickly becoming a staple. Chefs and restaurateurs are drawn to its\nversatility, as it can be served black, mixed with\nmilk and sweeteners, enhanced with flavored syrups,\nor infused with spices.",

To start, says Greene, “Food waste is not waste until it’s wasted. The amount of food we serve each day is massive, and it’s a great responsibility.” Greene and his colleagues track every pea and potato through customized production and waste software.Yet, he says, technology is not the key. “Empower and educate your staff to manage waste,” he says, “and ask yourself what you can do to contribute, for example, by visiting <a href=https://www.stopfoodwasteday.com/en/index.html><strong>StopFoodWasteDay.com</strong></a> to take the pledge and become a Waste Warrior.”"

Also, it has been shown that people waste less food in an all-you-can-eat environment when they have to carry their own plates, so consider ditching the trays, as Chartwells Higher Ed has done. Chartwells provides kitchen staff with tools like tomato sharks to get each bit of a tomato, and they use ingredients such as red bliss potatoes, which don’t need to be peeled. Greene also believes trends like root-to-stem cooking are positive and here to stay. But most important, he says, is to impart knowledge and connect downstream users with the entire food supply chain, from farmers to truck drivers. Once each person understands where a tomato comes from and all the work that goes into getting it to the plate, they won’t want to waste any part of it."

These mixes of hearty shredded vegetables make life a whole lot easier in the kitchen. Top them with crunchy wonton strips or croutons, fresh or aged cheeses and sliced colorful vegetables. Then drizzle over Sysco Classic salad dressings. To make the salad heartier, combine it with a protein such as thin-sliced <strong>Buckhead Pride Certified Angus Beef®</strong>, <strong>Sysco Classic Chicken Breast</strong> or grilled <strong>Portico Premium Shrimp</strong>, either directly on top or on the side. Add sliced bread or a sourdough roll and you have the perfect light meal."

Go to <a href=https://local.sysco.com/><strong>Local.Sysco.com</strong></a>, then enter your location and a range of proximity (in miles) and you will find all the local farmers in that radius.

Here we’ve improved on a classic by making a Sticky Toffee Pudding Cake paired with silky caramel sauce that you can pour at the table. In Italy, the winter holidays mean store shelves stocked with tall boxes of panettone—a sweet, brioche-like confection with dried fruit. We’ve used it to make a rich and festive Panettone Bread Pudding, accented with crème anglaise. If you have the time and the staff to do it, make this rich Gingerbread Chocolate Layer Cake. One of the most popular flavors of the season is eggnog. Use it to make a luxurious Eggnog Cheesecake With Gingersnap Crust."

The cookies, which start as labor-saving thaw-and-serve discs, allow for endless customization. The peanut butter cookies are packed with real peanut slivers, while the sugar cookie has a rich buttery taste. The chocolate chip cookie is one of Sysco’s most popular desserts on the market. Once you’re done shaping the sandwich, dip it in melted chocolate and decorate the outside with rainbow sprinkles, crumbled cookies or M&M’s Minis."

Everyone loves a delicious meatball, whether made from ground beef or turkey. Again, you can use gluten-free bread crumbs, or no bread crumbs, depending on your customer base.

In fact, beef prices have fallen steadily.

In East Texas, the barbecue is mainly influenced by Eastern styles, so you’ll find more pulled pork and pork ribs, as well as more sauce. Head west toward El Paso, and you can enjoy all kinds of Mexican barbecue, such as authentic carne asada and barbacoa, often made with goat meat from the head or cheek. But the heart of Texas barbecue country is in and around Austin. Germans and Czechs immigrated to the area and brought their cooking traditions with them. Here you’ll find huge open firepits proudly featuring a variety of woods: hickory, pecan, mesquite. The primary offering is often brisket, followed by pork ribs and sausage. The great thing about slow-smoked brisket is its versatility. Use it across dayparts, as part of a breakfast taco in the morning and in sandwiches or enchiladas in the afternoon."

                                "“If it’s not cooked over wood, it’s simply not barbecue,” says Michael Vogt, Sysco Culinary Consultant, Charlotte. You could also say, “If it’s not pork, it’s not North Carolina barbecue.” Other regions have their briskets and beef ribs, but in North Carolina, pork is king. How do you know you’re in North Carolina? “Spice-rubbed pork ribs glistening in sauce and succulent shreds of the shoulder piled high on a soft white bun,” Vogt says. The region is also known for smoking the whole hog, and the sauce is vinegar-based and not too tomatoey."

                                "The star of Memphis barbecue? Cleaver-chopped pork shoulder, served on a plate with slaw, beans and bread or on a sandwich made with a fluffy Wonder Bread-like bun. Add thick, sweet sauce and a traditional mayo-based slaw. No matter how that meat is delivered, “Our obsession with the moist, hacked bits of smoky, charred flesh is the stuff of Southern culinary lore,” says Spencer McMillin, Sysco’s Memphis Culinary Consultant. Smoking methods vary, but the more respectable joints use pit smokers—dark rooms filled with rotating, pork fat-crusted shelves that go for up to 14 hours at a time. In addition to pork shoulder, you’ll find plenty of ribs, divided into two categories: dry-rubbed and wet-mopped. Most dry rubs consist of some variation on brown sugar, cayenne, garlic salt, onion powder, paprika, a dried herb or two, and white and black pepper. Mops are ubiquitous and mostly follow a basic formula: one part apple cider vinegar, ¼ part water, ½ part brown sugar. Add a small handful of salt and spices, plus yellow mustard and ketchup. The mops are applied in various ways, generally at the end of the cooking process, much like a sauce. They provide an acidic and sweet counterpoint to the juiciness created by the slow-melting fat."

The sauce is a tomato-molasses mix with variations from tangy to spicy.” And while other regions focus on one type of protein or cut, Kansas City uses a wide variety of meats with a focus on the brisket point, which yields the signature burnt ends. “Burnt ends are a staple of KC style, with the notoriety of the fat-to-texture ratio that makes the meat as flavorful as it is.” The Block and Barrel Burnt Ends are the perfect example of Kansas City style. “I season the meat with the Sysco Imperial <strong>BBQ Spice</strong> before heating to drive home the flavor and, of course, a coat of the Sysco Imperial <strong>Kansas City Style BBQ Sauce</strong>. Served with some onion straws and pickles, that’s a taste of Kansas City.”"

For us Angelenos, the idea of barbecue is simple: hot coals, nice cuts of meat, some veggies, and call it a day.” LA’s Latino community has always made use of its parks and public spaces for grilling. “We think of barbecue as a social outing, when everyone gathers around the grill, beer in their hand.”",
                                "LA also is now home to some of the best Asian barbecue in the world and is the fount of grilling fusion. This spirit is exemplified in Udave’s Bulgogi Carne Asada, ready to serve at a gathering when paired with the Filipino-inspired Adobo Chicken, Mexican-Style Corn and Pickled Persian Cucumbers."

                                "According to Technomic’s MenuMonitor, mainstay flavors on holiday menus include cranberry, mint, gingerbread, eggnog, sweet potato, nutmeg, hazelnut and cinnamon—all natural fits for holiday desserts and beverages. Emerging flavors that chefs could spotlight include bergamot and finger limes. For restaurants with a creative pastry chef on staff, the sky’s the limit when building a holiday dessert and drink menu.",
                                "Operators without the in-house expertise can still satisfy the demand for seasonal tastes by customizing everyday dessert options, dressing them up to capture the festive essence of the season. Cheesecake, for example, takes on holiday flair with seasonal fruit, white chocolate, crushed peppermint candy or an eggnog-based sauce.",
                                "With LTO beverages, thoughtful presentation is essential. A simple cappuccino might be a stale on after-dinner menus, but adding peppermint-flavored syrup and whipped cream easily elevates it for the holidays. Mulled and spiked cider can get a seasonal lift with the addition of an apple or orange slice and a decorative mug. Spicy Mexican hot chocolate crowned with velvety foam, topped with a cinnamon stick, and paired with traditional cookies (or cinnamon-dipped churros) appeals on many levels: comfort, warmth, ethic favorites. Topping warm drinks with a sturdy seasonal cookie like a snickerdoodle also reinforces the holiday theme. If possible, it never hurts to have the aroma of the holidays in the air, either—the scent of spiced cobblers, cookies and cakes wafting through the dining room evokes warm memories and sets the stage for dessert sales."

                                "Train servers to offer a simple cue for desserts when taking orders: Be sure to save room for our warm Sticky Toffee Pudding—it’s only on the menu for a few weeks.",
                                "This isnt the time to bury desserts or specialty coffees on the regular menu —a separate menu or table tent will remind customers you’ve got something special to cap their meals. It’s an add-on opportunity because the demand is there, says Adam Clay, Sysco’s Category Manager for Bakery and Convenience. Having a separate menu gives desserts the attention they deserve.",
                                "Ideally, servers should be trained to promote coffee and dessert orders, especially since coffee or tea will help balance out the richness of a decadent dessert. But menus that point patrons toward complementary dessert-drink combinations can accomplish the same thing. Making that recommendation—Here’s your dessert, and here’s the beverage that’s going to make those flavors pop,—paints a complete picture, says Angela Flenoy, Sysco’s Director of Category Management, Beverage.",
                                "Plenty of holiday lunches are celebrations, too. Scaled-down portions of seasonal LTOs and festive beverages provide a manageable treat that doesn’t overwhelm.",
                                "Flights of desserts, especially those with a limited run, are perfect for diners who want to indulge (but not too much), or who plan to share. Espresso or other drinks served several ways are another option. Depending on the makeup of guests you might be serving, larger portions might work too: Saying, How about a warm cobbler for the table is one way to upsell and reinforce the whole family experience, says Clay.",
                                "If you would rather turn tables than have guests linger over dessert and coffee, consider selling takeout-friendly desserts, such as premade bars or mini cakes trimmed for the holidays (i.e., packed in optional gift-style containers. Many restaurants do a brisk business supplying whole pies or cakes to busy customers looking for a shortcut for a family meal or a host gift. Ask your sales consultant about the varieties and flavors in Sysco’s Pies-To-Go program.",
                                "Promote an all-day selection of holiday-themed desserts and premium coffees, cocoas and hot ciders for the legions of snack fans. A s’mores hot chocolate is the perfect antidote to an overcast late fall or winter day."

In the process, they created decadent cult favorites like lobster baked potatoes and truffle mac and cheese. Next, vegetarian and plant-based eating became more popular—and sometimes the best place on the menu to find vegetables was among the side dishes. Finally, diners started to crave customization. Instead of having the chef decide what starch or veg should go with what protein, today’s patrons want to pick and choose their own sides—treating them almost like shared small plates or tapas."

Home cooks might steam or boil veggies, but they wouldn’t sous vide carrots and toss with French butter and bonito flakes. People dine out to feast on specialized dishes such as Duck Fat Confit Fingerling Potatoes or Cauliflower and Lobster “Mac” and Cheese. It’s that chef-driven elevation—the quality of the ingredients, sophisticated techniques and presentation—that makes the difference, whether the dish is larded with bacon, vegan or gluten-free."

With dandelion greens, marinate them or toss them with an acidic vinaigrette, such as one that uses anchovies and lemon. You can also mix them in a salad with a more neutral green such as butter lettuce or curly endive. When using collard greens, “I would use plenty of fat and flavorful braising liquid to cook them down,” says Roberts. “And it can also be turned into a soup.”"

If there’s one thing she has learned about greens as a chef, it’s that you always remove the stem to get that nice consistency of texture—but don’t throw that stem away. “You can take the tender leaves and chop them up in a salad, and then pickle the stalk,” says Roberts. “Leafy greens are so versatile because you do have two vegetables in one,” she adds. “I make a lot of beets, and I love to cook the beet greens, too. I sauté them with a little lemon and olive oil. Instead of throwing away the stem and greens, which most people do, you are making another delicious dish out of it.”",

                                "It’s no secret that Valentine’s Day is one of the busiest days of the year for restaurants across North America. According to the National Restaurant Association (NRA), Valentine’s Day is the second-most-popular holiday for dining out in the U.S., with Mother’s Day taking the top spot. When asked in an NRA poll which factors they considered most when choosing a Valentine’s Day dining destination, 42 percent of patrons stated they chose to dine at a favorite restaurant—either their own or their partner’s. Twenty-one percent based their choice on whether or not the restaurant had a romantic atmosphere, while 13 percent picked a location that offered a special menu or promotion. With so many restaurants competing for business on the big night, what can you do to stand out on Valentine’s Day?",
                                "While traditional Valentine’s Day dinner specials certainly can bring the crowds, the holiday presents restaurateurs with the opportunity to curate a distinctive experience for their patrons and think of little ways to make customers feel special.",
                                "It’s all in the details, such as greeting guests with a champagne toast or giving them a small plate or takeaway box of stunning chocolate truffles at the end of the meal.",
                                "The truffles shown above are surprisingly quick and easy to make. Use <strong>Baker’s Source Fudge Brownie Mix</strong>, which is baked, rolled and dipped in melted <strong>Sysco Imperial Chocolate Chips</strong>, then topped with your decoration of choice. This sweet treat is the perfect end to a romantic dinner.",
                                "Looking for another way to sweeten the holiday? Try planning a hands-on activity, like teaching guests how to make romantic-themed cocktails for an extra fee. Do it early, before the house gets busy. You’ll engage customers and, more importantly, create vivid memories of your venue for when the next special occasion arises."

At this time of year, build your seasonal menu using gorgeous red and yellow beets and yellow squash. Look for butternut and acorn squash (and their cousin, pumpkin) with bright orange and golden-yellow flesh, which can be stuffed or cubed and roasted in the oven. Consider dark leafy greens such as collards and beet greens for a hearty winter salad. (Like this recipe for <a href=https://foodie.sysco.com/recipes/winter-greens-salad/>Winter Greens and Warm Pork Belly Salad</a>.) Get creative with hearty potato preparations, too. You can access every variety, from russet to Yukon gold to exotic purple sweet potatoes, from Sysco Imperial Fresh produce, Fresh Point and now—by overnight delivery— from Frieda’s Specialty Produce."

For Chef Colin Greensmith’s Hasselback Potatoes, which use the same knife technique, the preparation is otherwise deliciously simple: just olive oil, salt and fresh thyme, with a sprinkling of chopped  bacon for garnish."

From Chef Andrew Langdon, the dish makes a wonderful light lunch or dinner. Likewise, Chef Luce has roasted red and yellow beets with the best ingredients of the season: bacon, butter, walnuts and a zesty mixture of lemon juice and Mike’s Hot Honey.

Barnes says one common mistake he sees is restaurants trying to do too much. “Customers want to make quick decisions. They want to be presented with what’s guaranteed to be good and with something that they shouldn’t miss.” Instead of overwhelming guests with everything from soup to nuts, Barnes suggests paring down the menu so it focuses on what your restaurant does well and what is making a profit, as well as on low-labor items that don’t burden the kitchen.",
                                "“Fonts, colors and contrast are all crucial elements to good design,” says Barnes. With dim restaurant lighting and an aging baby boomer population, easy readability is also key. And if you use photos, be sure they are high-quality images that reflect what the final dish will look like."

In some cases, chefs have left food service, and fewer young people are choosing to enter the profession. To attract talent, owners are challenged with remaking restaurants as healthy, appealing places to work. To that end, Unilever Food Solutions has helped launch the <strong>Fair Kitchens</strong> movement.",
                                "Led by chefs and industry professionals, the movement emphasizes communication, empathy, respect and mentorship. Start by going to <a href=https://www.fairkitchens.com/><strong>FairKitchens.com</strong></a>, where you can watch videos of chefs and operators telling personal stories of the impact the movement has had on their businesses. According to Chef Neil Doherty, Sysco’s Senior Director of Culinary Development, transparency and fairness are integral to ahappy and productive work environment. Here are some of his keys for fostering a positive kitchen:",

It’s a mouthwatering opportunity for restaurants: Instagram is free, and it markets your images straight to a following of foodies. Best of all, if you take care and give customers what they crave, they will do most of the work for you – sharing with their own friends and followers. Here are five ways to build your customer base and increase loyalty by sharing your world of food and fun on Instagram."

If your restaurant or catering business has taken steps to reduce its carbon footprint, showcase it during your holiday events. Using sustainable disposables is a simple way to show your guests that you are concerned about the environment. Not only are these pieces good for the environment, but they also provide a more attractive (and memorable) way to present food than traditional disposables. SuppliesOnTheFly offers a large selection of eco-friendly disposables from Leafware®, VerTerra, PacknWood, and others. Choose from a variety of options, including dinnerware made from fallen leaves, bamboo and other sustainable materials."

Incorporating chalk into your buffet is a good idea throughout the year, but what better time than the holidays to get even more creative with this versatile tool? Hire an art student from a local high school or college to decorate your chalk displays with colorful and festive holiday images. These works of art not only add color to your display, but also serve as a great conversation-starter for guests."

In fact, 38 percent of today’s restaurant traffic is off-premise, according to Restaurant Business News. Take out is not right for every restaurant. It can disrupt the flow of in-house dining, and third-party delivery companies take up to 30 percent of the meal price in commission. We spoke with Sysco experts about how operators can grow their takeout and delivery business without losing control over quality and revenue. Here’s what they had to say. Goll suggests promoting your to-go menu on colorful cards that you can include with the bill or keep by the register. Sniffen recommends that every takeout business set up online ordering. Once you do that, he says, don’t forget to update your menu, whether it’s on your own site, UberEats, Yelp or Google."

While the original recipe of steak, onions, and cheese in a hoagie roll has its die-hard fans, this traditional favorite has evolved over time to incorporate new ingredients and flavors. Let’s take cheese for example. There’s provolone or American cheese, and yes, even Cheez-Whiz.  While green peppers are a staple in most recipes, if you’re looking to bring the heat, hot cherry peppers, long hot peppers, and banana peppers are great options to try. Feel free to also add mushrooms to help round out the flavor.",

                                "Ribs are a staple at barbecue restaurants across the country.   Whether it’s Memphis, Chicago, Kansas City, Texas, the Carolinas and beyond, these cities all do barbecue differently, but they all have ribs on the menu.",
                                "It’s hard to believe that in the mid-1800s, ribs were considered a byproduct and were either discarded or given away by meatpacking plants. That is a far cry from today, where the demand for ribs is high, and with good reason. They’re delicious, fun to eat, and you can dress them up and cook them in a variety of different ways, flavored by a wide range of different things. But not all ribs are created equal. One of the first differences you may notice when it comes to beef ribs versus pork ribs is their size. In general, beef ribs will be bigger, and often take longer to cook compared to pork ribs in general. For most cuts of pork ribs, they will be reasonably lean and moderately meaty when compared to beef. Let’s take a closer look at the various types of both beef and pork ribs.",
                                "There are two main types of beef ribs – Back Ribs and Short Ribs. Beef back ribs are cut from the back of the cow in the dorsal area behind the shoulders. The meat can be braised or barbecued. Beef Short ribs (also known as plate short ribs) are a cut of meat from the lower part of the cow’s rib cage (the short plate) behind the brisket. Beef short ribs have a lot of fat content and marbling or connective tissue, so they’re a great choice for hands-off, low and slow cooking methods.",
                                "Beef ribs will have a much higher fat content and be closer to even portions of fat and meat. Compared to pork ribs, beef ribs have a strong, distinctive flavor that don’t need much additional seasoning other than salt and pepper. Alternatively, pork ribs have a taste that is not nearly as strong as beef and is sometimes described as oddly sweet. But pork ribs are a blank canvas and can pair well with a variety of different combinations of spices, rubs and bbq sauces.",
                                "There are four main types of pork ribs – Baby Back Ribs, Spare Ribs, St Louis-Style Spare Ribs and Country-Style Ribs. Baby back ribs are cut from the top section of the rib cage and are shorter than spare ribs (hence, the name “baby”) and are considered the leanest and most tender of the pork ribs.Spare ribs have longer bones and less meat than baby backs. They are cut from the belly and are considered by some to have a richer flavor. St. Louis-Style spare ribs are spare ribs with the rib tips and brisket flap removed, giving them a uniform rectangular shape. The country-style rib is the meatiest of the ribs styles and is located in front of the baby back rib. Interestingly, this cut is not actually from the ribs and instead is more of a pork chop.",

So now is the perfect time to make your dessert menu shine by showcasing innovative ideas that are sure to tempt your customers. Miniature desserts are a hit all season long. They can be offered not only for post-lunch and dinner treats but as anytime snacks or on the go. Smaller desserts offer better portion control and allow guests to explore different tastes and a variety of flavors. They’re also easy to put together with thaw and serve and ready to bake scratch-ready products. Sysco’s Cutting EdgeSolutions now features two exclusives, new individual portion desserts that are perfect for any dessert menu, as well caterings, buffets, and to-go business.

Don’t forget to serve toppings like candies, crushed cookies, nuts, marshmallows, and fresh fruit to add color and texture to each masterpiece.

They want their food to provide nutrition for their body and they want to be empowered with menu choices that support their sense of wellness—however, they define it.” As more consumers go green and pile their plates with plants, Sysco saw the need to build more <strong>plant-based</strong> options into our assortment.",
                                "Sysco’s new <a href=https://shop.sysco.com/app/catalog?q=7158622&utm_medium=web&utm_source=syscofoodie&utm_campaign=segment_american&utm_content=amr_plant_based_burger_patty><strong>Sysco Simply plant based burger patty</strong></a> has a substantial 20 grams of protein and provides a classic taste and texture comparable to the real thing. Made with non-GMO pea protein, this vegan patty is gluten-free, non-dairy, has no artificial flavors, and contains zero cholesterol and 50% less fat than traditional meat patties.

                                "With so many delicious alternatives that look and taste like traditional ground beef products, it’s easier than ever to promote plant-forward eating trends and appeal to guests looking for dining experience that support their dietary lifestyles."

                                "The undying popularity of home renovation shows speaks to how passionate we are to improve and transform real estate. Flipping houses has become an opportunity to turn over property and increase profits. The same is true of the culinary landscape as well. Hamburgers consistently rank among Americans’ favorite foods. Now take that winning combo of beef and bun and rework it, take it up a level, and you’ll find guests are willing to spend a little extra on what they consider an upgraded specialty sandwich.",
                                "The first step to creating the perfect burger makeover is to start with quality meat from Fire River Farms. Fire River Farms product assortment includes fresh ground beef as well as premade, ready to cook or frozen patties that offer freshness, flavor, and consistency. Sysco’s Fire River Farms Classic homestyle seasoned beef patties are tender-formed for fast cooking and an extra-tender bite. They are individually quick frozen for superior flavor and freshness, and allow you to cook straight from the freezer. Fire River Farms Bulk Ground Beef allows chefs more opportunities for customization when blending, sizing and seasoning their burgers. Fire River Farms Classic fresh 81/19 ground beef chubs help you create juicy recipes with the quintessential ground beef flavor and texture. Plus, bulk chubs let operators use what they need and then store the rest thanks to the extended shelf life for economical inventory control.",
                                "Once you’ve got your great patty, now is the time to branch out and have fun with your buns. With so many specialty breads and rolls available, it’s easy to create a signature offering with a specific texture and flavor profile. Next comes the cheese. Studies show that cheese not only drives satisfaction and crave-ability, but also has a significant effect on the perceived quality and value of a burger. While traditional choices like American, cheddar and Swiss still reign supreme, bold new flavors like smokey-char or high-heat varieties bring added value along with a spicy kick. Softer cheeses such as Gouda or Havarti have an ideal melt that can also take burgers to a whole new level. Fresh produce is also integral to building a good burger, adding layers of color and texture with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and pickles. But adding unique ingredients like pineapple, beets, pickled vegetables, avocado, pico de gallo and fresh peppers is a great way to justify specialty prices and create bigger profit margins.",
                                "“In a great burger, you taste the whole thing together, but you can still make out each ingredient individually. If you can nail that balance, you know you’ve got something special,” says Chef Neil Doherty, Senior Director of Culinary Development.",
                                "Whether operators use fresh or frozen products, chefs can create dishes with confidence knowing Fire River Farms Classic beef patties are backed by a full HACCP program and Sysco’s unparalleled Quality Assurance standards. Fire up the grill, flat top, or charbroiler and get ready to win over guests, drive new sales and improve your bottom line with this great American classic."

                                "The shift went long. Several staff called out. There are already so many other pieces of equipment and areas of the kitchen that need to be cleaned and employees are already doing more tasks than ever before. It’s easy to make excuses to avoid cleaning cooking equipment, especially ovens, at the end of the day.",
                                "Commercial ovens are the workhorses of any foodservice kitchen. But the fact that they’re used so extensively also means they’re prone to accumulating food particles, grease, and other debris. This can lead to everything from issues with flavor to performance to the risk of smoke and fire. Not only that, but failure to clean your oven can lead to costly heating inefficiencies.  Ultimately, while oven cleaning may not top anyone’s list of favorite things to do, it’s an important part of running a clean and high-performing industrial kitchen.

                                "Simply spray the product onto a warm (120-130° F) surface to be cleaned, covering all soiled areas completely with gel. Allow the cleaner to penetrate grease deposits and do not let it dry on the surface. Wipe off the dissolved and loosened grease with a damp cloth and then rinse the surface with clear water.",

                                "Miniature desserts are a hit all season long. They can be offered not only for post-lunch and dinner treats, but as anytime snacks or on the go. Smaller desserts offer better portion control and give guests the chance to explore different tastes and a variety of flavors. They’re also easy to put together with thaw and serve and ready to bake scratch-ready products. Sysco’s Cutting Edge Solutions now features two exclusive, new individual portion desserts that are perfect for any dessert menu, as well caterings, buffets, and to-go business. Dense, rich, and exceedingly moist, the Olive Oil Citrus Cake is made with real lemon and orange juice for a delightful citrus punch that fits beautifully with the season. The Basque Cheesecake has a light, souffled interior and delicious, caramelized interior that can easily be dressed up with a variety of sauces, fruits, and nuts. Create “dessert shooters” by layering scoops of Sysco Imperial Old Fashioned ready to bake Blueberry Pie with Greek yogurt accented with honey and cinnamon and topped with a rich and crunchy piecrust streusel.",
                                "Easter and Mother’s Day are especially big with the brunch crowd and buffet-style celebrations are a great way to serve large groups and introduce them to new items and flavors. As a sweet ending to all the savory selections, set up a dessert station where guests can mix and match options to create their own unique treats. Offer sliced or miniature servings of different cakes, pies, cookies, and bars along with a variety of sauces, dips, fruit coulis, and flavored whipped creams. Don’t forget to serve toppings like candies, crushed cookies, nuts, marshmallows, and fresh fruit to add color and texture to each masterpiece. Use this same premise to design dessert charcuterie boards as portable, to-go options for family gatherings at home. Guests still get to try and sample a variety of tastes, and operators can command a premium price point with an artfully arranged board.",
                                "Father’s Day is another great opportunity to promote desserts while also tapping into new trends. Cocktail-inspired desserts are increasingly in demand and a perfect option for Dads looking to indulge. Add bourbon to Baker’s Source Classic Chocolate Cake Mix for a rich, luxurious batter and top with an alcohol-infused “hard” sauce for a decadent spin on a traditional cake. No time to bake? Plate slices of thaw and serve chocolate or vanilla cake and add a boozy chocolate sauce or flavored whipped cream laced with liquors like bourbon, Amaretto, or Bailey’s. Spiked milkshakes are also an easy way to incorporate different liquors and create an endless selection of flavor profiles. As a creative twist to the childhood “Cookies and Milk” classic, add cookies to the blend, then top as a garnish for a nostalgic touch and “instragrammable” visual appeal.",
                                "Fourth of July is all about the red, white, and blue, and packaging patriotic-themed desserts as a togo option is a great opportunity for customers to boost profits by targeting guests who are hosting backyard barbecues and other gatherings. Keep time and labor costs down using thaw and serve and ready to bake scratch-ready products. Create dessert skewers with Sysco Imperial New York-style Cheesecake Cubes interspersed with strawberries or raspberries, blueberries, and marshmallows. Layer white cake with homemade blueberry sauce, whipped cream cheese topping, and strawberries for a red, white, and blue trifle. Use Baker’s Source Classic Blueberry Muffin Batter to make a classic Bundt cake and serve with a side of macerated strawberries. For ultimate ease, start with Sysco Classic’s thaw and serve Red Velvet Cake with cream cheese icing. Simply coat the cake in red, white, and blue sprinkles for a festive wow factor.",
                                "The warmer weather of late spring and summer are great for featuring gourmet ice cream sundaes. Begin with Wholesome Farms Supreme Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and then add endless sauces and toppings, cake, pie, and cookie pieces, grilled or baked fruits, candies, and nuts to create the ultimate summer treat. Cross-utilize ice cream and keep the spirit of summer strong with ice cream cookie sandwiches. Sandwich chocolate or vanilla ice cream between two Baker’s Source Classic Chocolate Chip Cookies and roll in sprinkles, mini candies or chocolate chips, nuts, or other toppings. Experiment with different ice cream flavors and cookie varieties to create endless combinations."

                                "Chef Armando Pomales has come a long way in his culinary career. His mother was not enthusiastic about preparing home-cooked meals. Pomales himself was a picky eater that would happily enjoy his favorite meal of microwaved scrambled eggs any day of the week. His culinary curiosity was first ignited in high school while taking home economics classes. “I loved the challenge and the outcomes of mixing ingredients together and having a final product to taste,” recalls Pomales.",
                                "His fascination with food preparation continued after high school and was the catalyst for Pomales to attend the culinary program at El Paso Community College. “The program grew significantly throughout the years, and I was able to graduate with two degrees,” says Pomales. “While I was attending culinary school, the chef instructor recommended [that I]  apply at one of El Paso’s prestigious fine dining restaurants as a garde manger in 1999. At Café Central, I moved up the ladder from garde manger, sous chef, chef de cuisine, to lastly executive chef.”",
                                "During his time at Café Central, Chef Pomales was influenced by the late Trae Apodaca, the restaurant owner, and a “second father” to Pomales. “He instilled in me a passion for the restaurant industry. He taught me about anticipating customer needs, service, the foundation of my plate ups, how to identify fresh ingredients, and much more,” says Pomales. After 16 years of holding every position at Café Central, he transitioned to join the Sysco team in 2016.",
                                "Today Chef Pomales is passionately committed to ensuring the success of Sysco customers by creating exciting menu options with global flavors. “I believe it all starts with the customer,” he says. Pomales is committed to building a meaningful relationship with our customers by fostering trust and building all business components from the kitchen to the dining room.",
                                "Chef Pomales’ heritage of Puerto Rican and Mexican cultures has significantly impacted his culinary style. Memories of his grandmothers in the kitchen gave Pomales a window into the signature flavors in his culture. “One being Mexican and the other Puerto Rican, you can only imagine the wonderful smells that would pour out of each kitchen and encircle my sense of smell,” he recalls. “If I wanted Puerto Rican tamales wrapped in banana leaves or some Mexican tamales in husk leaves, I had it. I remember the smell of chiles roasting, beans cooking, and fresh masa being made.”",
                                "Pomales’s palate for Asian flavors and training in French culinary techniques have also added a layer of depth to his signature culinary style. “I love ingredients that tell [the] story behind [a] product, the region where it comes from, or the people responsible for growing or producing it,” he says. “Living in Northern Mexico and Southern Texas, [it is] easy to play with different flavors. I like to use a variety of dry and fresh chiles to make dishes such as salsas and guisados like chile verde and chile Colorado.” Pomales also enjoys integrating Asian ingredients like tamari, fish sauce, chiles, and cilantro into his cooking.",
                                "Now, with a culinary career that has spanned two decades, Chef Pomales looks back on all that he has learned and would encourage aspiring chefs to pursue their culinary passion with dedication and perseverance. “This is not a job, this is a career [that you] must have a passion for,” he says. “People are quick to critique your food, but you shouldn’t get dismayed. That is the learning process of perfecting your ‘sazon’. Have the willingness to always have an open mind, adapt, and overcome. Keep learning.”",
                                "Chef Pomales has come a long way from those microwaved scrambled eggs that he enjoyed as a child. He has been nominated four times for the illustrious James Beard Award and was invited to be the featured chef at the PGA Tour Championship for professional golfers. “Food is the one language that we all understand, and those smiles and comments people give me are what make me happy and proud.”"

                                "Orianna Mendez was born in Venezuela to a loving family that loved to cook. Drawing inspiration from the sights and smells of her mother’s kitchen, her father’s barbecue, and her grandmother’s comfort food, Orianna aspired to walk in their footsteps. “I always said that I wanted to do what they do,” she says. “My mom had a really good “hand” for cooking. In Latin America, when someone is really good in the kitchen without [training], you say that person has it ‘in the hand.’ “"

                                "Although Orianna inherited her mother’s “hand”, she never saw cooking as more than a hobby, until she toured a university campus. As Orianna explains – “On a trip I made to Panama looking for universities, I was doing research for other career [options] until I arrived at Universidad Interamericana de Panamá (Interamerican University of Panama). [When] I saw the Philipina hanging in the corner, it was like love at first sight, and it made me think a lot. I had never considered [a culinary career] but I saw the study plan and began to investigate a little more. [Pursing the culinary arts] was one of the easiest decisions [I’ve ever] made and one that I do not regret.”",
                                "Unfortunately, just before Orianna could start school, an unexpected health crisis threatened to derail her plans. At age sixteen, she was diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome – a rare neurological disorder that causes the immune system to attack the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. The debilitating condition caused her to become paralyzed from the neck down. As she explains, “The disease was painful and difficult because I had to learn to walk again, to be able to grasp a fork and knife to eat, [and] even bathe.” After four emotional months of physical therapy, she made a full recovery just before heading off to college.",
                                "Despite Orianna’s excitement for the future ahead, she faced several challenges after leaving the only home she had ever known in Venezuela, to begin a new life at Universidad Interamericana de Panamá. “My first month in Panama was very hard,” she describes. “I was 17 years old in a new country and culture, starting a new career, and living alone.” Training courses added an additional layer of difficulty for Orianna, with sessions lasting as long as sixteen continuous hours. Within a few months of starting school, Orianna suffered a relapse. “For a month, I couldn’t do anything at all,” she recalls. “I had to start from scratch with [my] physical therapy.” Luckily, the head of the university understood Orianna’s challenges, and worked with her to ensure that she would successfully complete the semester."

                                "Remarkably Orianna’s worth ethic never suffered despite her ongoing health issues. “I always [gave] 100,000% of myself, knowing that when I got home I will not be able to walk until the next day due to the pain in my legs. I [just kept] going.” Her persistence paid off when the school’s Executive Chef, Santiago Kantun, recommended Orianna to Alexander Chacón, the General Manager at Sysco Panamá. “As Orianna explains, “We were at a university food fair organized by faculty, and Sysco was one of the sponsors. [Santiago] told me that Don Alex was looking for someone who enjoyed cooking, had empathy, a good attitude, and [strong] work ethic, who is also responsible.”",
                                "Alexander Chacón accepted his recommendation, and after graduating, Chef Orianna was hired as Business Advisor for Sysco Brands. In less than a year, she was promoted to Sysco Business Resources Coordinator. “My job is very rewarding,” she Chef Orianna. “I am helping restaurant owners succeed in the industry [by understanding] their business and what they really need to be successful.” Orianna enjoys seeing her customers thrive through Sysco solutions that deliver innovative ideas, cost-saving strategies, and on-trend menu suggestions. “The Business Resources [department] is more than a team of chefs, it’s…where our customers can lean in and share their dream ideas [and concepts], and then we make it possible,” she describes. “I believe that with every product, resource, and follow up, we [provide] everything our customers need to be successful and…help the local gastronomy grow.”"

                                "Chef Orianna believes that food represents culture, country, people, and even emotions. “My thesis topic [in school] was “Techno-Emotional Cuisine,” where I managed to make people remember important moments in their lives through food,” she explains. “For me, that is powerful…and I think that all [chefs]…should feel proud.”",
                                "Orianna’s Latino heritage shines through in her cooking style. “I really like to use strong flavors,” she explains. “[I like to use] lots of olive oil, lemon, passion fruit, cayenne, coconut oil, and chilly flakes. Latinos usually fry many things, and so do I, but I try to use many [other] techniques as well. One of the techniques that most fascinates me right now is fermentation and smoking. I have seen many Latin American chefs, and an increasing number of Panamanian chefs use these ancestral techniques to prepare beautiful, comforting dishes that have that ‘wow effect.’ These techniques honor the past that we Latinos respect so much, and it is something that this generation of chefs…hope to master.”",
                                "Orianna strives to create exciting food presentations like her idols Chef Grant Achatz and Massimo Bottura. As she describes, “Their creative, crazy, experimental cuisine[s] that bring you sensations and emotions, is definitely the style I want to carry and develop.” Though Chef Orianna enjoys creative freedom in the kitchen, the feeling of providing what she refers to as “comfortable mom food” remains a priority. Just as her mother had done throughout her childhood, she aspires to create meals that feel like home and taste like family.",
                                "Chef Orianna’s advice to other chefs is to find the intersection where purpose meets perseverance. “I believe that discipline is the basis of everything, especially in cooking,” she says. “Study, do your research, practice, and…have a passion for what you do. That’s the key.” Chef Orianna has overcome and accomplished so much at her age, and is excited for the future ahead in the career that she loves. “I am immensely proud of the power [chefs] have with food. By cooking, we are representing a culture, a nation, [and] ourselves."

Kids’ taste buds range from adventurous eaters to picky hard-to-pleasers, so here are a few tips and tricks to help you plan for big success with your smallest diners."

Yogurt and applesauce pouches are also in-demand kiddie favorites that parents love. The mix-and-match nature of the menu isn’t just fun for diners;   it also helps operators and kitchen staff avoid costly and confusing substitutions that come with a more rigid kids’ menu."

                                "Longtime Sysco client Joe Davidson is an entrepreneur, restaurant owner, and a legend in the barbecue world. Joe has garnered over 300 barbecue cooking titles, including the Jack Daniels World Championship. Most recently, the illustrious title of Inductee into the 2020 Barbecue Hall of Fame.",
                                "Joe’s journey to becoming a barbecue legend began, as he would describe it as “…one happy accident after the other”. While pursuing a Master’s degree in agricultural engineering at Oklahoma State, Joe worked as a welder to pay for his education. At twenty-five, he ambitiously invested $2,000 to design and manufacture a dozen meat smokers that he then took to the Oklahoma State Fair. Not only was he able to sell all twelve smokers, but Joe walked away with dozens of pre-orders for more smokers – immediately catapulting him into the meat smoker business.",
                                "As a man with tremendous ambition and commitment to his craft, Joe decided two things needed to happen: he would have to manufacture the best smokers in the world, and he would need to be one of the best at cooking barbecue to do it. A year later, Joe got his first taste of the competitive barbecue scene. He explains, “I was hooked right then. I just loved cooking barbecue. I love the camaraderie. I loved the aspects of seasoning, [and] barbecue cooks being mentors to young men and women out there trying to get a good start.”",
                                "As Joe’s winning reputation grew on the competitive barbecue circuit, so did production at his smoker manufacturing plant in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Regular tours of the facility brought in domestic and international dealers who were just as interested in smokers as they were in tasting award-winning barbecue. Joe recalls, “We were cooking out in front of our plant all the time, and I just felt like, man, we have to open a restaurant.” That’s exactly what he did.",
                                "In 1995 Joe convinced his good friend and cook-off rival, Jeff Stehney, to open their first restaurant in Stillwater, Oklahoma; followed by Oklahoma Joe’s opening in Kansas City a year later. With expectations high and numerous barbecue legends calling Kansas City home, Joe decided “we’re going to have to cook better barbecue than everyone else if we’re going to do this at all.”",
                                "He went to work devising a plan to ensure that quality and consistency would be two main ingredients at both his restaurants. He explains –",
                                "“The key to our success was to document a process of our steps of what makes great barbecue and executing them identically every time. That means using the same type of wood to cook with, the same cookers, and the same dry rubs that we took with [us] for competitions. It was all in that process – well documented, spelled out, not only in writing but through an apprenticeship program over training pitmasters to be cooking the way I cook”.",
                                "Sysco is proud to say that we have provided Oklahoma Joe’s products and operational support for the past ten years. When we asked Joe what comes to mind when he thinks of his ten years of being a Sysco client, he says –",
                                "“The difference is the relationship. All the innovation, the marketing, and the know-how [that Sysco brings] to the table. Any time that I need something, all I have to do is pick up the phone and call one of the executives with that team, and they make things happen very quickly.”",
                                "On working with Sysco Sales Consultants, Joe says “ [it’s almost] like they get paid by Sysco, but they’re working for me. They are literally in my stores three days a week at least. I will tell you that role has intensified since the pandemic as well. So that’s when they really became …an extension of us because supply channels have been compromised in many instances.”",
                                "At the onset of the pandemic, one of those supply chain challenges was the rising cost of beef. Joe tells us, “During the time that brisket was getting so expensive… the [Sysco] Chef came up with the idea of doing a chicken fried ribeye sandwich. How many people have ever had a chicken fried rib eye? We did this and I will tell you it’s one of my favorite sandwiches now at a barbecue joint. [This] brings an incredible experience to my customers, and also allows us to make a fair profit. That’s important.”",
                                "Looking forward to a future of unknown challenges and unlimited possibilities, Oklahoma Joe’s has set their sights on becoming a nationwide supplier of their award-winning barbecue – by building their own facility. “We’ve already started the process… and then that facility, in turn, will allow us to enter into the foodservice outside of barbecue as well.”",
                                "Now a Barbecue Hall of Fame inductee with over 30 years of success as a smoker manufacturer, and restaurant owner, we asked Joe what his proudest accomplishment. “I’m most proud that we’re still a family run business. There’s a level of satisfaction [that’s] hard to describe.”",
                                "Sysco is proud to call Oklahoma Joe’s Barbecue a valued client, and we have no doubt that even more success is coming his way in the years ahead. If you’re ever in Oklahoma look up one of Oklahoma Joe’s six locations."

Now, nine years later and with two locations serving the community, it’s clear that customers are sold on the restaurant’s house-made flavors, and finger-licking sauces."

                                "Lee grew up in Little Rock, Arkansas. His fondest childhood memories bring him back to family barbecues and watching his father command the grill. Lee’s parents each have a dozen siblings on their respective side of the family and are accustomed to cooking for large gatherings. By the age of twelve, Lee became the extra set of hands that prepared meals for Sunday dinners.“My father smoked meats and I would help him build a fire in the mornings,” he explains. “My mother was responsible for making the sauces [so] I helped her make the sauces and seasonings.”",
                                "In 2012, after years in corporate America, Lee decided to pursue his passion for cooking by opening the original Wings Cafe. “We hoped to change the landscape of wings and try to provide more regional flavors and experiences,” he recalls. “The way they do their wings in Buffalo, New York is a little different than we do in Kansas City, or the South [in general]. Having the opportunity to provide a platform to create different flavors [is our main focus].”"

                                "In the fall of 2015, Lee opened the second Wings Cafe location. As he describes, Wings Cafe is a modest “mom and pop artisanal-style wing joint”. The menu features chicken wings, fish and shrimp plates, chicken strips, sandwiches, salads, and a wide array of wet sauces and dry rubs. “We have a dry rub that we make in-house called “Slap”, Lee describes. “For a while, we were kind of unique to be one of the only places that provided it. It’s one that we recommend to all customers that come in. It sets us apart – a lot of people usually get a buffalo or a barbecue or an Asian zing, but for us we [offer something different].",
                                "Lessons from his mother on how to make seasonings and sauces have served Lee well in creating diverse flavor options that include: Garlic Ranch, Chex Mix, Shanghai Bourbon, Firecracker, Voodoo, and many more. “We created most of the flavors from customer recommendations and built on those families of flavors”, he explains. “It’s a real diverse array of sauce profiles and the same thing with the menu itself. There is a little bit of everything.”",
                                "From the very beginning, Lee has trusted Sysco to support his business with the resources and products that allow him to thrive. “When we first got started we actually went to a [Sysco] test kitchen and they really helped us to expand our vision on where we wanted to be with products and sauces,” he recalls. “Sysco is great. They provide a lot of great products. Most of the products that we order are at a level of quality that we don’t typically get anywhere else. [With] other companies it feels as though they are providing a product based on its cost to them and not necessarily the cost and quality to the customer.”",
                                "With two locations on the map, nearly a decade in business, great service, and remarkable flavor options – Wings Cafe is the place to go for some of the best wings in Kansas City. If you are ever in the area be sure to stop by and let us know which you prefer – the Voodoo sauce or the Slap."

It’s an excellent time for operators to capitalize on high-margin events and create holiday menus that embrace the comfort and familiarity of timeless dishes and allow for experimentation with fresh, on-trend ingredients for a creative spin on the classics. But with so much to do as far as food prep, cooking and serving, the kitchen can easily become overwhelmed. Sysco has a wide range of fantastic products that not only elevate your menus but provide key time and labor-saving solutions.",

A light marinade keeps the carving moist and flavorful, and there isn’t the intensive labor involved in cooking a whole turkey.

Instead of peeling, cooking, and processing potatoes, this boil-in-the-bag item can be kept hot in a warmer box or served right out of the bag. You can also layer in extra flavor by adding in other vegetables, such as parsnips, cauliflower, or celery root. Rather than adding butter and cream, consider other dairy products like crème fraiche or mascarpone to create a deliciously different item.",

As Ben Porter explains, “I’ve been with Sysco since the beginning of my restaurant career, before Cantina Louie. These last 18 months, we’ve had more challenges than we’ve ever seen in the restaurant industry. Sysco did a better job than most and did a really good job keeping us up to date on supply chain issues. We’ve had numerous trips to the test kitchens to come up with different ideas with their corporate chefs [and] there is a constant dialogue that goes on between us and Sysco’s upper management.”",
                                "Porter’s relationship with his Sales Consultant, Stephen Bond, is as strong as they come. “We’ve got the best [Sales Consultant] in the Sysco world!” he declares. “I’ve had Stephen Bond since day one. I know that he is one of the top Sysco guys – he’ll bend over backward for us. He’s always there; he keeps us in the loop on market trends: what’s coming, what’s going, and price trends. That has given us a leg up on other restaurant groups in the market. Our relationship with Sysco is driven by Stephen Bond as our Sales Representative.”",
                                "Two additional Cantina Louie locations are set to open in St. Johns, FL this year, with more to come as the restaurant is always in what Porter calls “calculated growth mode”.  To see more from Cantina Louie and discover current and upcoming locations <a href=https://cantinalouie.com/>click here</a> to visit their website."

And while there are multiple ingredients that make a sandwich great, from the meats and cheeses to the veggies, sauces, and condiments, equally important is the type of carrier you choose. The right bun can add flavor and put a new spin on a classic. But in today’s tight economic market, with a growing need to focus on efficiency and control costs, making homemade breads and buns has become too labor intensive for food service operators. Sysco has the right solution with a wide selection of delicious Baker’s Source thaw and serve buns and rolls that deliver fresh baked taste with minimal prep and labor, ideal for creating the perfect sandwich build. Frozen at peak freshness to immediately seal in the moisture, this process preserves the shape and appearance of the product while helping maintain the baked dough structure and moisture levels inside. When you slack them out, these buns and rolls taste as fresh as the day they were produced. Plus, you can pull only what you need, reducing waste and saving food cost. Although ready to serve as is, chefs can put their own twist on these products and easily customize them by basting with a flavored butter or sprinkling tops with different seasonings, sesame, or poppy seeds.",

They need to be easy to train on and use, easy to dispense and refill, and reduce overall steps in cleaning procedure. Sysco’s Keystone brand, a partnership of Sysco and Ecolab, has put a focus on providing solutions that save time, cost, and labor for your operations.

In recent years, though, it’s having a kind of second renaissance, thanks in no small part to TV food shows, social media and increasingly mobile customers. Trends travel faster than ever before, and as a result, chefs and restaurant operators are getting more creative about what goes into their signature sandwiches. From changing up the bread and cheese, to using more seasonal produce, to piling on ethnic or regionally specific ingredients, here are just a few ways sandwiches can be taken to a whole new level."

For a more adventurous approach with protein, operators can scale up their selection with currently trending options such as venison, pork schnitzel or <strong>Portico Alaskan Sockeye Salmon</strong>.",

Sauces and spreads, such as basil pesto, truffle aioli or jalapeño jelly, are easy ways to impart flavor. Items that typically act as sides, like potato chips, crispy onion rings, mac and cheese, coleslaw, or even spicy cheese snacks, can instead be placed on the sandwich itself, creating new layers of flavor, texture, and fun.
