                    "Servicing banquets and <strong>catering events</strong> are huge opportunities for <strong>foodservice operators</strong> during the holidays. Groceries aside, the essential items for any successful catering operation are the products that <strong>keep the food at a safe and optimal serving temperature</strong> during an event. Some operators may even want to create an “extra kitchen” in order to support as many events as possible. Insulated pan carriers, chafing dishes, holding cabinets, heated banquet carts, portable warming trays, countertop food warmers and induction warmers, in addition to serving utensils, tableware, busser tubs are essential equipment and will be in demand. With the ending of pandemic-related food handling protocols, there is now a renewed demand for more elevated, full course experiences, with a bit more glamour.",
                    "Make sure you have china, as well as proper flatware and glassware, on hand, versus just stocking disposables. Take inventory and make a list of items you’ll need to add and replenish and begin ordering 10 to 12 weeks before the anticipated demand. This timeline will allow for production, shipping, and any necessary customization or modifications to meet your specific requirements.",

In today’s challenging market, there is a massive fight for labor. It’s crucial to start planning now for your seasonal hires before your competitors can scoop up the most reliable talent. Plus, it’s not just about having enough help; it’s about having enough <strong>well-trained</strong> help. Give yourself at least six weeks to train so staffers can hit their stride with regard to service standards and the culture of your operation. Attract workers by having applications readily available at the host stand, reaching out to previous seasonal workers and college students, and promoting jobs on social media. You can also consider working with a staffing agency in your area to avoid relying on the availability of staff for one-off events.",

Not to mention, if someone doesn’t show, you have another team member that can step in and fill in a gap.",

                    "Good news – there’s a <strong>catering industry comeback</strong>! Last year, <strong>in-person holiday parties</strong> and <strong>catered corporate events</strong> were on the rise as companies hosted these gatherings as a way to bring people together again after what seemed like an endless period of virtual meetings and remote workplaces. This year, the trend is continuing, with many workplaces actively planning event catering and holiday themed events as the ultimate way to entice the entire staff to return, even if it’s just for the day or night, and build back the office culture. And big catered events aren’t limited to just corporate functions. Weddings, holiday parties and private events – outdoors and inside – are also ramping back up. For operators, now is the chance to regain some of that pre-pandemic magic as across the board customers and guests are craving more elevated, full course experiences, yearning for a bit of real-world party glamour. <strong>Catering</strong> <strong>revenue growth</strong> has the potential to boost sales by 20 percent or more, so it’s becoming an increasingly appealing revenue stream for foodservice operators of all types.",
                    "It’s a super competitive landscape, however, so operators need creative event planning ideas to take catered functions to the next level. Here are some of the top <strong>Catering event trends</strong> for 2023 that can help guide you towards a successful season:",
                    "<strong>Personalized Catering</strong> – Customers want experiences specifically tailored to them and their guests, not just a generic, one size fits all solution. This brings us back to the basics – it’s all about the relationship you build with the customer, and it’s important to listen to them and address their needs. Customers are looking for event menu customization. Be inventive, be flexible and create a menu from the ground up that reflects your customer’s unique tastes and preferences. Exceed their expectations and they’ll re-book year after year.",
                    "<strong>Experiential Catering</strong> – In today’s social media obsessed world, people are craving connection to their food, the chef, and each other. They want to become part of the event, posting it on Instagram, and sending selfies and video clips to followers far and wide. Guests are craving <strong>unique event experiences</strong> through inventive menus, sensory-focused dining, eccentric or thematic decoration, theatrics, unique locations, and activities. It’s more important than ever to create a “WOW” experience that guests will remember and talk about months after the event. Need some ideas?",
                    "A great example of this type of catering comes from valued Sysco customer – <a href=https://www.kennyandziggys.com/?utm_medium=magazine&utm_source=showcase&utm_campaign=foodie_magazine&utm_content=Issue_33>Kenny & Ziggy’s Delicatessen</a> in Houston, Texas. This hugely popular delicatessen has hosted a variety of theme nights, from various wine dinners to a Rumanian night with traditional folk dancers, even a Marvelous Mrs. Maisel themed party, complete with a 3 course menu featuring favorite foods from the series as well as specialty cocktails. Their team also hosted a hugely popular cooking class at a local Jewish Community Center that turned into an exhibition kitchen event. They brought in a bartender and had all the guests cooking and creating a variety of traditional Jewish favorites. A huge success, they look forward to hosting more of these events. To learn more about Kenny & Ziggy’s unique events, <a href=https://foodie.sysco.com/trends/kennyandziggys/?utm_medium=magazine&utm_source=showcase&utm_campaign=foodie_magazine&utm_content=Issue_33>click here</a>.",
                    "<strong>Cultural culinary experiences</strong> – Be it cultural wedding ceremonies, holiday gatherings or other celebrations, guests really want to highlight the cultures they are from and focus on specific foods that represent their backgrounds.  One of the best things about food is how it lets chefs tap into their creativity to work with global flavors and create a sense of cultural immersion for guests. Go international with your menus and explore unique ingredients, unusual preparations, and incredible flavors.",
                    "<strong>Farm to table catering</strong> – Post shutdown, guests have taken a keen interest in where their food and beverages come from. Guests are definitely looking for more that’s “<a href=https://local.sysco.com/>local</a>”, but this doesn’t just mean sourcing ingredients from local farms. This is a great opportunity to showcase what makes a city, region, or state special from a culinary standpoint. It could mean featuring a specific ingredient unique to that certain region, or embracing the type of cuisine as a whole.",
                    "<strong>Childhood Classics</strong>  – The trend of <strong>childhood classics in catering</strong> is all about embracing the nostalgia of comfort food but adding a fun twist. Familiar flavors are back in style as people crave dishes they know will make them feel at ease and remind them of good memories from their childhood and simpler times. Chefs can breathe new life into these favorite items with a new sense of playfulness and fun, unexpected presentations. Who knew pop tart themed pastries, waffle bars and even mini hot dogs could inspire such delight.",
                    "<strong>Vertical food stations</strong> – This is a great way to capture guest’s attention! Doughnut and pretzel walls were a big thing last year, and this trend looks set to continue. True to the expression of “one eats with the eyes first”, guests are attracted by the presentation and appearance of food displays almost more than the taste. Walls can hold a variety of food and drinks, from appetizers to cocktails, and be customized to fit any theme and style of event. These unique serving stations allows guests to enjoy delicious food and inspired conversation at the same time. These stations invite guests to serve themselves, so they also help free up staff to attend to other responsibilities.",
                    "<strong>The Early Bird</strong> – While most events seem poised for afternoon or evening time slots, don’t miss out on the important meal of the day! Morning meetings and pre-lunch conferences are becoming ever more popular. <a href=https://foodie.sysco.com/sysco-foodie/spring-into-flavor/action-stations/?highlight=Breakfast%20stations&utm_medium=magazine&utm_source=showcase&utm_campaign=foodie_magazine&utm_content=Issue_33><strong>Breakfast stations</strong></a> and “refuel” stations are a great way for companies to keep their audience fresh, more engaged, and more likely to fully participate in the event. Plus, brunch is becoming an increasingly popular choice for weddings and private events as well."

While there are still moments of heightened melodrama and exaggeration, there is consensus among industry professionals that the show is so accurate, some can’t stand to watch. The stress. The sense of urgency. The unrealistic demands for perfection. The verbal assaults. The <strong>anxiety</strong>. The series showcases the painful reality of what it’s like to work in a kitchen and the high emotional and physical price it costs staffers. “The Bear” brings to light the dark underbelly of <strong>mental health issues</strong>, including <strong>depression</strong>, anxiety, <strong>addiction</strong>, <strong>eating TV</strong> <strong>disorders</strong> and more, that are inherent in the restaurant business yet are rarely addressed.",

                    "From preserving the well-being of the ocean and its species to supporting positive working conditions in ﬁshery-dependent communities, seafood sustainability covers a lot of ground, and purchasing seafood that’s good for both businesses and the environment is a top consumer priority.",
                    "Beyond delicious seafood options, we believe in providing our customers with ideas and resources to promote a better future for our planet.",
                    "<strong>Here are a few simple ways you can do your part in the back of the house.</strong>",
                    "<strong>#1: Tinned and Canned Fish</strong>",
                    "As is the case with most “trendy” food items, tinned fish has already been around for hundreds of years. Tinned fish is a centuries-old way of preserving and eating fish in Europe (specifically Spain and Portugal) where the fish are harvested at the peak time and canned in a variety of oils and spices to complement their natural flavor. A nutritional powerhouse, these fish are a convenient and affordable source of protein and, depending on the type of fish, can also be a great source of omega-3 fatty acids and other essential nutrients. A prominent food trend that’s been taking social media by storm, tinned fish is also prized for being sustainable and waste-free. Most canned ﬁsh varieties use smaller species like mackerel and sardines, which have abundant and healthy populations. Harvesting them doesn’t pose a signiﬁcant threat to the well-being of ocean life. It’s shelf- stable and since it doesn’t need to be refrigerated, it requires less energy to preserve the product. Lastly, since it’s not perishable until it’s opened, there is minimal food waste. It allows operators to buy in bulk and can help balance out the budget. Delicious served with crusty bread, good butter, and fresh herbs, it can easily elevate dishes and add a punch of umami to salads, sauces, charcuterie boards, pasta, rice, and more.",
                    "<strong>#2: Dry Aging</strong>",
                    "Dry aging is a trending method that lets chefs extend the shelf life of their fish while also intensifying its flavor. Rooted in Japanese traditions, the basics of dry aging involve meticulous cleaning, gutting, and scaling of the fish, then they are hung from hooks in a moisture and temperature-controlled refrigeration system for days, even weeks. The enzymes in the fish break down over time, resulting in more umami, tenderness, and fattiness to the seafood, with a melt-in-your mouth texture and a deeper, more complex taste. This technique can be used for a range of raw dishes like crudo, tiradito, ceviche, and sashimi. The amount of time needed for dry aging varies depending on the ﬁsh, but the payoﬀ is worth it. It’s a fantastic way to reduce food waste, cut costs, and create delicious meals that your guests will love.",
                    "<strong>#3: Zero Waste Cooking</strong>",
                    "Cooking with leftovers, scraps, and other odds and ends is not only creative, but saves time and money, and is better for the environment. Instead of throwing away seafood scraps like shrimp shells and fish bones, use them to create flavorful broths, creams, dips, and sauces. You can also use them to flavor rice, pasta, or vegetables. Meat from the head and skeleton can be made into a “mince” for Fish croquettes. You can also use different fish trim to create a delicious, sustainable ceviche. With zero waste methods, every part of the fish is utilized, resulting in increased profit margins for you as an operator. Plus, you’ll be contributing to a more sustainable food system by reducing landfill waste."

While still working at the family’s restaurant, his passion for creativity and food inspired him to enroll in culinary school where he excelled as a student chef, eventually launching his career as one of the best chefs in Buffalo, New York.",

                    "Born and raised in Buffalo, New York, Chef Shea Zappia’s career path was set at an early age. When he was only about 6 or 7, he made a marinade for chicken for his Dad to use on the grill. His Dad loved the marinade and asked him to make it again. Too young to read labels or know what the ingredients were, he could remember the color of the bottles and spices he had used and was able to re-create it. His Dad purchased a restaurant in the suburbs and it became a playground for Chef Shea. He used to research the menus and highlight words he didn’t know and look them up. He read books and watched “Great Chefs of the World” on PBS. He’ll even tell you he became “obsessed” and hasn’t looked back since. At 13, he stopped “playing” and began working in the kitchen as a dishwasher, then moved up as a line cook and eventually as a Chef through his late teens and early twenties. While still working at his father’s restaurant, Chef Shea’s passion for creativity and food inspired him to enroll in culinary school at his local community college. Feeling a bit stifled out in the suburbs and craving more of the “big city experience”, Chef Shea joined the Culinary Team, a group of young chefs that are brought together to compete on a global stage, through his local chapter of the American Culinary Federation. As Chef Shea says, “This is where I received my classical training”. The commitment to the team required long hours working, training, and traveling to competitions all over the Northeast and Canada. He was appointed team captain and led the “hot food” team to 3 silver medals and 1 bronze, which garnered him a nomination for Student Chef of the Year. All the hard work and dedication paid off, as this distinction, along with great timing, helped catapult his career. His hometown of Buffalo was just on the verge of a resurgence, and, deciding to return home to his roots, Chef Shea landed his first executive chef job at 24 years old. In 2013 he was nominated by the Buffalo News for Buffalo’s Best Chef.",
                    "Growing up in an Italian household, Chef Shea is well-versed in Italian cuisine but has a passion for Spanish and Latin cuisine as well. He loves to cook anything braised, especially short ribs. “I love the process of layering flavors and the time it takes to develop something so rich and delicious”. He’s also a big believer in the power of oils. As he explains, “While it’s tempting to look for what is least expensive, quality oils are a big foundation in developing delicious recipes.”",
                    "A dedicated husband and father to two adorable sons, it’s hard to imagine Chef Shea once tried starting a motorcycle gang at the tender age of 18. Now part of the Sysco family, we’re so glad he decided not to head out to the open road and ultimately pursued a culinary career. As a Sysco Culinary Specialist, he’s a mentor, a guide, and committed to helping his customers succeed. Whether you need a sounding board for your latest dish or a friendly face to turn to with any culinary need, Chef Shea is always there with a helping hand.",

                    "The son of parents who left India and came to Houston in the 70s, Chef Anil Chacko didn’t originally set out to become a chef. He loved cooking ever since he was a young child, when he would help his mom in the kitchen, stirring ingredients in a pot that he couldn’t even see over! After graduating high school, he went to the University of Texas and earned a bachelor’s degree in economics. While attending college, he had a night-time job serving ice cream at Marble Slab Creamery. The foodservice world had started calling again.  Although armed with a great degree that could lead him down many avenues in the business world, Anil decided he wanted to pursue that passion he had as a child and went on to attend the Culinary Institute of America in beautiful Napa Valley, California. While at the CIA, Chef Anil worked as a food runner at La Toque in Napa Valley.  Then, after receiving another degree, this time in the Culinary Arts, Anil kicked off his career with a chef apprenticeship under his mentor Chef Almir da Fonseca at the Wine Spectator Greystone Restaurant. Going on 14 years in the industry and having worked in California and Hawaii, Anil decided to return to Houston, not only home, but also a great food city.",
                    "A fan of Italian cuisine, one of Anil’s favorite recipes is risotto. A fan favorite among most Houstonians, Mexican food is also close to his heart. Outside of the kitchen, with a thirst for adventure, Chef Anil says, “I often sought an adrenaline rush through cliff diving, sky diving, bungee jumping, and free falling.” His love for extreme sports is equally mirrored by his fearless attitude as a chef and willingness to experiment in the kitchen. If you need inspiration for a new dish to add to your menu or just a friendly face to turn to with any culinary need, Chef Anil is always there with a helping hand.",
                    "Chef Anil’s favorite quote:",

                    "Raised by a single mother in Birmingham, AL, Chef Brian Wilkinson started cooking at a young age, inheriting his grandpa’s marinara recipe that fueled his culinary passion. Assuming leadership at family cookouts was instinctual for him, as was cooking for his friends, and it was here he recognized that both guiding and cooking were his creative outlets.",
                    "Chef Brian attended a small culinary school in his hometown, and upon graduating, came across a job posting for a restaurant named L’etoile in Charlottesville, Virginia. After a few years at L’etoile, Chef Brian followed a few cooks to the Clifton Inn, where the new chef there needed a pastry chef. Even though Chef Brian had never worked pastry, he discovered a newfound passion. He was good at the basics and really enjoyed doing it. After a year of crafting his own desserts, he decided it was time to spread his wings and learn more. A former cook he had worked with had moved to New York, so he called him up and asked if his restaurant was hiring in pastry. As fate would have it, they were indeed hiring and Chef Brian decided it was time to move to the Big Apple. He began his big city career working for Bouley, one of New York’s top fine-dining restaurants, before moving on to Eleven Madison Park, a 3-Michelin-star gem that has also been ranked among the world’s 50 best restaurants.",
                    "Chef Brian gained his vast expertise from NYC’s cultural melting pot. Most proud of his experience as a pastry sous chef at Eleven Madison Park, he’s learned to thrive in an environment that fosters culinary excellence and innovation.",
                    "Aside from enjoying movies at home with his wife and expanding his vast Lego® collection, Chef Brian is incredibly passionate about creating strategic solutions to help his customers thrive in the most competitive restaurant scene in the country. As he explains, “as a chef, my calling extends beyond the kitchen. I’m dedicated to coaching and empowering people to elevate their businesses.”",
                    "Admittedly frugal himself, Chef Brian translates that into his role of helping chefs operate more efficiently and sustainably. He champions resource consolidation and waste reduction, focusing on elevating plate value while minimizing food costs. “I love showing people the breadth of what we offer,” says Chef Brian. For him, Sysco’s offerings extend far beyond what meets the eye, and he takes great pride in demonstrating how to utilize Sysco products to create fine dining dishes and experiences.",
                    "As a Culinary Specialist in the NY-Metro region, Chef Brian finds immense satisfaction in guiding restaurants toward uncharted culinary territories. With a keen eye for innovation, he asserts he “spends more time on Sysco Shop than anyone else,” scouring the inventory and unearthing exciting new products. Sharing his discoveries with clients brings him joy, as he takes pleasure in showcasing the endless possibilities Sysco offers.",

Several red Angus cows and their calves slowly start grazing the grasses, taking advantage of the cool stillness of morning before the summer heat forces them to seek shade. It’s a peaceful, almost idyllic vista that looks like an ad for Farm & Ranch Magazine. Now, let’s pivot to your reality. Your dish machine just broke down, your line cook called in sick, and you still need to finish out next week’s schedule. All you can picture right now is where that big bottle of aspirin is for the gigantic headache that’s forming in your head. That ranch image we just conjured up? Yeah, that’s pretty much the last thing you would ever envision as your Sysco driver starts stacking cases of <a href=https://sysco.com/Sysco/Products/Products/Sysco-Brand-Family/Fire-River-Farms><strong>Fire River Farms</strong></a> burgers, <a href=https://sysco.com/Sysco/Products/Products/Sysco-Brand-Family/Butchers-Block><strong>Butcher’s Block</strong></a> Reserve Angus strip loins and ribeye into your cooler.",
                    "But wait, let’s take a minute. This is important. Why? In today’s world, environmental, social, and cultural issues are changing the landscape of how diners think about food and how they make choices of where to dine out.  We’ve all heard the buzz words –  <strong>food waste</strong>, <strong>sustainability</strong>, <strong>farm to table dining</strong>, <strong>locally sourced</strong>. Consumers are becoming increasingly more conscious of where their food comes from and they want to know how it was sourced. When asked, most servers would probably say, “I don’t know. But I can check with the chef”, or better yet,  “Oh, we get our meat from <a href=https://sysco.com/>Sysco</a>”. Sigh… But we’re here to tell the story and map the journey.  The more educated your entire staff, both back and front of house team members, not only the greater appreciation and understanding they’ll have for the product itself, but the more pride they’ll have that your operation embraces the strong values our society is promoting."

Growing up with cattle and crops on the Nebraska family farm she became a member of the local 4-H club, showing cattle and learning about raising beef. After high school she studied animal science in college with an emphasis on production and meat science. Bryan came from agricultural roots as well, and when they met and eventually married, they both knew they wanted to build a life and raise a family on a ranch. Whether they had one head, or up to 30 head, the impact of leadership, the importance of chores, and the appreciation for the cycle of life were lessons they could pass on to their children and the younger generation of their community.",
                    "Not only was Vonda practically “born” to raise beef, but her passion to help get more beef on people’s plates led her to begin working for <strong>Cargill</strong> and selling beef as well. Upon graduating college, Vonda began her career with Cargill and has now been with the company for 35 years. As part of the Sysco Trade Sales team, Vonda manages all boxed beef that is ordered across all the <a href=https://sysco.com/Contact/Contact/Our-Locations.html>Sysco operating sites</a>. She has extensive knowledge of market trends, pricing, specific cuts, and what’s going on in the industry. In her role at Cargill, Vonda has been able to gain deep insights into exactly what operators and producers want and what they’re looking for in their beef products. As a cow-calf operation, Vonda is literally at the very beginning of the food chain. A certified breeder with extensive animal husbandry training and experience in beef cattle genetics, Vonda works with trusted partners and artificially inseminates her “mama cows” to put less strain and stress on the animals.  “Bred from scratch”, these animals have the perfect DNA Vonda needs, and will mature into healthier cattle with traits that are more desirable for muscle mass and marbling, qualities that producers, foodservice operators and consumers are looking for. But it takes more than just good genetics to develop a great product. Vonda has a fully hands-on approach to her cattle and carefully monitors and makes sure each one is taken care of. The Behrens rise early each morning and immediately head out to check on the herd. It’s a 24/7 job, and the animals always come first. Before they even have breakfast themselves, Vonda and Bryan are making sure the cows and calves are fed, that they have fresh water, flies have been kept at bay, and the herd appears overall happy and healthy. The cattle graze the land and consume a natural diet, but their nutrition is also supplemented with hay and grain. Because the cattle feed on so much grass, Vonda and Bryan have a deep respect for the land and work hard to maintain it. While they need to rely on Mother Nature and good ol’ rain to provide the moisture in the grasses, keeping the weeds controlled, managing flies and mending fences are just a few of the day in the life responsibilities at the ranch.",
                    "Vonda’s passion for ranching is not financially motivated, rather it is driven by her love of nature and the nurturing aspect of taking care of animals. She’ll tell you about the experience of watching a cow labor and deliver her baby calf with such emotion and joy you can’t help but get caught up in the wonder of it all. With equal passion, she’ll also talk about working outside in freezing temperatures, in the dark of night, to administer aid to a young calf in a frantic effort to save it. These are not just animals to Vonda and Bryan, these cattle are an extension of their family. Fun fact, Vonda even names all of her calves. Each year has a theme, and this year it was flowers. One of the youngest, newest members of the cattle family is Rose."

                    "You’ll hear a lot of conversation about <strong>“sustainability”</strong> and while many talk the talk, they don’t always walk the walk. While numerous definitions of sustainability abound, one of the best ways to sum it up is it’s the ability to exist and develop without depleting natural resources for the future. Vonda and her family have a deep appreciation for the land and are dedicated to caring for the resources entrusted to them. Grazing cattle on the land helps keep carbon locked in the soil, recycles nutrients, and provides habitats where wildlife can thrive. In a broader sense, family farms also sustain their very communities. Even in a small town such as Norwich, <strong>VB Bar Ranch</strong> helps bolster the local economy through the purchase of supplies and materials through small businesses and hiring local workers. Their farmstead has deep roots in ranching, having been homesteaded back in 1880 and even evidenced with a 1912 date emblazoned on their stock tank. Applying best practices and ranching responsibly, the Behrens pride themselves on their commitment to keep this legacy for generations to come.",
                    "Looking towards the future, ask Vonda what some of the biggest challenges are facing the industry today and you might be surprised by the answer. Yes, there are the higher costs for feed, medicine, and vitamins to keep cattle healthy. Labor and farm equipment come with steeper prices as well. And higher interest rates to purchase land can make it hard to break into this industry if you haven’t inherited a property. With all these headwinds, no one would be surprised if existing and would-be ranchers just decided to hang up their hats for good. But for families like Vonda’s, there’s way too much heart and soul invested to make them turn their backs on the livelihood they love. So, what is their greatest concern? For many family-owned ranches, it’s the aging rancher and succession planning.  According to the USDA, the average age of a farmer/rancher in the US is 57.5 years. A lot of younger people would love to get into farming and do it full time, but as mentioned earlier, it can be too expensive to get into it. Some of the larger farms need help, but it can be hard to compete with factory jobs that offer better pay, health insurance, and benefits. Vonda and her husband have always been committed to giving back and tirelessly volunteer with organizations such as Future Farmers of America and local 4-H clubs to help educate and build youth leaders in the agriculture space. Here at <a href=https://sysco.com/>Sysco</a>, we’re proud to be an official supplier for the <a href=https://www.rodeohouston.com/>Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo</a>, the world’s largest livestock show and family friendly experience that facilitates better agricultural practices and provides year-round educational support to Texas youth. We all want to see the legacy of family farms continue, and for that to happen, it’s imperative to get the attention of youth and keep them interested in farming and agriculture. The good news is despite the obstacles, statistics are starting to show that there has been a higher interest in agriculture among the younger generation within the last few years.",
                    "Another challenge according to Vonda is simply the lack of understanding and appreciation for the level of dedication and investment of physical, financial, and emotional resources that go into breeding and raising cattle. Expenses are tied up in ranching and ranchers don’t recoup their costs until after the animal is sold. Diners may relish that juicy hamburger they ordered from their local burger joint, or delight in a perfectly seared ribeye on a plate at their favorite steakhouse, but they just don’t think that much of it. Your servers and back of the house staff probably have a similar attitude. They may have no idea where the beef came from, and everything that went into bringing that burger or steak from <strong>farm to table,</strong> and the extreme pride ranchers take in doing what they do. Times are a-changin’, though, and <strong>today’s consumer craves transparency</strong> and there is more of a desire to know where their food comes from. We want to educate and empower all parties, at both the operator level and at a consumer level, and foster a feeling of humility, gratitude, and respect towards food. Through these supplier stories and this type of storytelling, we feel we can.",
                    "Vonda’s ranch and her story is just one of many in the <strong>Cargill</strong> family of suppliers.  These ranchers have a level of passion and dedication to their cattle that ultimately results in the high quality and performance of our beef that you can see and taste. You can serve with confidence knowing that our beef comes from a trusted partner with higher standards to ensure a great tasting product every time."

Although originally skeptical that Houstonians would even know, let alone embrace, the traditional Jewish delicacies on his menu, Ziggy soon found his fears were unfounded as patrons lined up to dine on mile-high corned beef and pastrami sandwiches, plus classic favorites like chopped liver, Hungarian stuffed cabbage, chicken matzo ball soup and more."

As Ziggy will tell you, Kenny & Ziggy’s isn’t just about food. <strong>It’s about tradition</strong>. As a young teen, Ziggy’s grandfather Max left Hungary and sailed to the United States, ending up in New York City’s lower east side. After spending several years working in delis and learning the craft, Max and his brothers-in-law opened their own Jewish deli on New York’s famed Broadway.  Max’s son Gene then took the stage and eventually began teaching the deli business to his son, Ziggy. When he himself was just a teen, Ziggy was ready to open his own deli; however, Ziggy’s parents encouraged him to attend culinary school instead. He left for London, graduated from <a href=https://www.cordonbleu.edu/home/en><strong>Le Cordon Bleu</strong></a>, and went to work at London’s first Michelin three-star restaurant, <a href=https://www.le-gavroche.co.uk/><strong>Le Gavroche</strong></a>. But after two years, he realized the deli business was in his blood, and went back to New York to take over the family deli. Ziggy will tell you being a deli man is something he was destined to be, and he is, a <strong>third generation deli</strong> man three times over, having run successful delis in New York, Los Angeles and of course, Houston."

                    "Although <strong>deeply rooted in tradition</strong>, one of the keys to Ziggy’s success is that the business is always evolving. Whereas a lot of restaurants want to grow their business through expansion, opening more and more locations, Ziggy chooses a singular approach, focusing on one store and maximizing its potential. As he’ll say in his own words – “One tochus can’t dance at two weddings”. After the pandemic, as diners started making their way back into restaurants, they were looking for more unique and memorable moments through inventive menus, theatrics, and activities. Realizing this trend and determined to deliver a  “WOW” factor, Kenny & Ziggy’s started hosting themed events, including wine dinners, Vodka-Latke parties, “Romanian” nights, and their hugely successful Marvelous Mrs. Maisel Season Finale viewing party. For this event, the restaurant designed a three course themed menu with specialty cocktails and encouraged diners to come dressed in period attire and watch the finale in their private dining room, the Schmooze Room. Another great success story is the series of Valentine’s Day performances featuring beloved entertainer Dani Luv, originally from <strong>Sammy’s Romanian Steakhouse</strong> in New York. Diners were encouraged to “come and get some luv” and make reservations for an evening full of delicious food, drinks, live music, and dancing. Definitely a night to remember. But in addition to delighting guests with fun and frivolity, occasions that are truly “<strong>insta-grammable</strong>”,  Kenny & Ziggy’s also prides itself on creating meaningful events that bring people together in truly impactful ways. One such event is the Holocaust Survivor’s luncheon. Survivors and guests are invited to lunch for a day of noshing and remembering to continue the conversation and education of this horrible tragedy in history. Off site, Ziggy and his team have also hosted cooking classes at the local <strong>Jewish Community Center.</strong> Everyone participates in hands-on cooking, learning to create traditional dishes like blintzes and beet borscht, to new favorites including a vegan version of stuffed cabbage that uses Impossible brand meat. While Ziggy prefers to “stay in his lane” and remain loyal to the <strong>traditional New York Jewish cuisine</strong> he grew up on, he has added more vegan and vegetarian dishes to his menu based on customer demand and new dietary preferences. Again, evolving, but never straying far from his roots.",
                    "These immersive experiences have been extremely popular and well-received, and even more importantly, they have strengthened the ties of community and deepened his guest relationships. Loyal guests as well as new customers will keep coming back time and time again.  Ziggy has found a way to put a <strong>fresh, fun take on dining in the traditional Jewish deli, while still staying true to the unique and distinct heritage of his Jewish culture</strong>."

That’s why the NRA’s 2023 “What’s Hot Culinary Forecast” lists Southeast Asian cuisine as the top global flavor trend. <strong>Vietnamese</strong>, <strong>Filipino</strong>, and <strong>Singaporean</strong> cuisine take advantage of the bounty of their region and unique local ingredients to bring complex flavors to their dishes.",
                    "<strong>Vietnamese cuisine</strong> emphasizes the balance of flavor, between hot, sour, sweet, salty, and bitter as well as the balance of hot and cold foods. Traditional recipes incorporate a variety of fresh herbs, spices and aromatics including cilantro, mint, chili, ginger, cinnamon, and lemongrass and are considered essential to many dishes. Fish sauce, made from fermented anchovies and salt, is used extensively to season dishes and add simultaneously sweet and salty flavors to food. While not as well-known as other Asian foods, Filipino cuisine is distinguished by its bold combination of sweet, sour, and salty flavors. Cooking with souring agents, like different vinegars, evolved for taste and necessity, as it helped preserve food in the warm tropical climate. Calamansi (Phillipine lemon), tamarind, coconuts and fish sauce are also common ingredients in Filipino recipes. Several of these items can be found at Sysco’s specialty company, <a href=http://eiltd.com/>European Imports</a>. While most Asian cultures are rice or noodle focused, in Singapore they’re both. Dishes are usually based on a foundation of spicy, fishy sambal, sour herbs and/or complex citrus flavors. Spices including ginger, pepper, chile pastes, along with tropical fruits like durian, lychee, calamansi limes, coconut and curry leaves figure heavily into some of the country’s most iconic dishes.",
                    "Emerging flavors and ingredients include <strong>salsa macha</strong>, a trendy nutty salsa made with a rich chili oil from Veracruz, Mexico. <strong>Mangonada</strong> is a bold, delicious Mexican sorbet made with mango, chili powder and chamoy, delivering a sweet, salty, spicy, and tart flavor all in one bite. <strong>Yuzu</strong> is an aromatic East Asian citrus fruit with a strong fragrance that is traditionally used in ponzu sauce and growing on mainstream menus. The distant cousin to hot honey, <strong>spicy maple</strong> also brings a delicious dose of sweet heat to the table."

                    "Making it in business for 130 years requires more than just good product. It requires expertise, adaptability, and a passion for the job.",
                    "And since its modest beginnings as a seafood stand in New Orleans’ famous French Market in 1892, <strong>Paul Piazza & Sons Inc</strong>. has leveraged all these tenets to become one of the largest fully vertically integrated suppliers of Gulf of Mexico shrimp. Today the company processes more than <strong>30 million</strong> pounds annually of Premium, Wild-Caught, Gulf of Mexico shrimp. This represents nearly 1/3 of all Gulf landings.",
                    "When it comes to seafood, few things are more coveted or marketable than these delectable crustaceans renowned for their sweet, tender meat and delicate flavor.",
                    "But what exactly makes Gulf shrimp so special? Location. Location. Location.",
                    "One key factor that sets Gulf shrimp apart is the water they come from. The Gulf of Mexico is teeming with biodiversity, and its warm, shallow waters provide an ideal environment for shrimp to thrive. The combination of saltwater and freshwater from the Mississippi River creates a unique blend of nutrients that contributes to the shrimp’s distinctive flavor and texture.",
                    "What differentiates Paul Piazza & Sons from its peers is the company’s master tradecraft and dedicated tradesmen. Using traditional methods like shrimp nets  allows its fishermen to carefully hand-select and sort the shrimp so they are not damaged in the process. The catch is brine frozen , on board, as it is landed, which preserves the shrimp at the peak of freshness throughout the trip. Additionally, all shrimp are processed using only fresh well water rather than recycled water from the bayou, which delivers a product with a better appearance and no off flavors or odor at the operator level.  PP&S and Sysco standards mandate that all products are inspected for weights, counts, defects and overall quality and that they exceed industry and USDC Grade A standards.",
                    "“Only the best fishermen and fleets fish for us,” said Andy Neely, Paul Piazza & Sons Vice President of Sales and Marketing. “They are paid a premium to deliver quality raw material and they must follow <a href=https://www.paulpiazza.com/sustainability/>sustainable</a> practices with their vessels to help preserve our Gulf and our fishery. These guidelines and standards are followed to preserve freshness, product integrity and quality from the moment the shrimp come out of the water.” Paul Piazza & Sons require that each of their Captain’s all sign a Sustainability Covenant for every trip, ensuring they understand and support their standards.",
                    "The company’s commitment to sustainability is evident as they continue to work closely with state and federal agencies and non-government organizations. As a leader in the industry, Paul Piazza & Son is a founding member of and primary stakeholder in Fishery Improvement Projects in Texas and Louisiana, both coordinated by the Audobon Nature Institute’s Gulf United for Lasting Fisheries.",
                    "Chefs can serve Portico Shrimp with confidence knowing that the shrimp on their tables is sustainably sourced, fully traceable, and coming from a trusted partner with quality standards that ensure a great tasting product every time."

                    "“Only the best fishermen and fleets fish for us,” said Andy Neely, Paul Piazza & Son Vice President of Sales and Marketing. “ We’re proud of the deep relationships we have carefully developed with our fleets, our fishermen and our docks. These relationships enable us to provide the U.S. market with Premium Quality Wild Caught Gulf Shrimp each year.”",
                    "One such fisherman is David Aparicio Jr. The third-generation shrimper has been trawling the fertile waters of the Gulf since he was a kid learning the ropes with his father David Sr. and uncle Ernie Aparicio. For him, shrimping isn’t just a job – it’s a calling that runs through his veins.",
                    "“There is an immense sense of pride in bringing this level of quality shrimp to market,” Aparicio said. “Shrimping is an art and a very specialized fishery. It takes a long time to learn and master.”",
                    "While the “on board” amenities may have gotten a bit better – TV and Air Conditioning now, a few more creature comforts – for the most part the technology has stayed the same. The family is using the same shrimping methods as they did 100 years ago; visiting and tracking the grounds that were good in the past and following weather patterns. But they also credit their success to gut feelings and experience because shrimp are often driven by the makeup of the ocean bottom and their food source.",
                    "Another important piece of the puzzle is the actual nets, which are proprietary. Every captain has a particular way of handling and using them, and they often make their own. The way the nets are lowered into the water, boat speed, and other nuances are carefully considered by the crew, which consists of the captain, rig man, and deck hands. The boats make several drags per day or night – and each drag is relatively quick. They don’t want to let the shrimp drag too long – it negatively affects the quality. Shrimp are subject to predators and become damaged when dragged for extended periods. Reduced drag times are also more fuel efficient.",
                    "When the load is dropped, it’s literally “all hands on deck,” and they work together sorting, heading, rinsing, sacking, and freezing the shrimp quickly, which takes place within an hour after landing to provide the freshest frozen product.",
                    "While the exhilaration of hauling in a net bursting at the seams hasn’t changed for shrimpers, one thing that has is the rise of sustainable practices. One of those efforts the Aparicio family is using to achieve sustainability is more selective gear. To avoid catching everything in their path, including non-target species like sea turtles and dolphins, boats are equipped with bycatch reduction and turtle excluder devices that allow these species and other bycatch to escape while still catching shrimp.",
                    "The Aparicio family is proud of their reputation and dedicated to providing the highest quality shrimp, not cutting corners, and doing things right, because it’s just the right thing to do. The team at Paul Piazza Shrimp shares the same values, and there is a real mutual respect and appreciation for each other.",
                    "Chefs can serve Portico Shrimp with confidence knowing that the shrimp on their tables is sustainably sourced, fully traceable, and coming from a trusted partner with quality standards that ensure a great tasting product every time."
